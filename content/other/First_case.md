There are four [[cases]] in Icelandic. The '''first case''' in the [[Declension table|declension table]] is known as the "nominative case".<ref>On Ylhýra we refer to it as the "first case" for simplicity's sake since you will always see these four cases listed in the same order in the [[Declension table|declension table]].<br />
In Icelandic the first case is called '''nefnifall''' and is abbreviated as '''nf.''' Nefnifall literally means "naming case". The English name "nominative" also means "related to naming" in Latin.</ref> It is the default case for a word and it shows that the word is doing something — it is the main [[W:Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence.

The [[Helper word|helper words]] you use to force a word into the first case is „hér er“ ("here is").

Verbs that [[Cases caused by verbs|cause]] the first case include „að vera“ (to be) and „að heita“ (to be called).

Examples:

*'''Kötturinn''' minn borðaði kvöldmatinn minn. (My cat ate my dinner) – The cat is the main [[W:Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence.
*'''Hann''' er ekki '''góður''' '''köttur'''. (He is not a good cat) – "He" is the main [[W:Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence, "good cat" is in the first case because „að vera“ causes the first case.<br />
