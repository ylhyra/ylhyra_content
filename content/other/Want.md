{{a1}}

There are two ways to say “I want” in Icelandic:

*`mig langar` = ''I want, I desire''. This is the same variation as you might be familiar with from English, ''“I '''long for''' the carefree days of my youth.”'' meaning having a strong desire for something, but in Icelandic the meaning is not as strong and generally just means “I want”.
*`ég vil` = ''I want''. This is a bit more blunt than ''mig langar''. You can remember it from the English ''“It is my '''will'''”''.

They can be used almost interchangeably, but since `mig langar` is more about your desires (it is softer) and `ég vil` is more about your demands (it is more blunt), it's better to use `mig langar` in situations where you're not sure which one to use. There are many situations and phrases where either one is always used.
