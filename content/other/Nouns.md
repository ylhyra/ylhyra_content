'''Nouns''' (''nafnorð'') are the class of words that contain objects, creatures, ideas and so on such as: car, human, leg, happiness, Iceland.

All nouns in Icelandic have a [[gender]] (he {{kk}}, she {{kvk}}, or it {{hk}}). They can exist both with and without the [[definite article]] (the "the") attached at the end.

Nouns are [[declined]] in four [[cases]]: the [[nominative]] {{nf}}, [[accusative]] {{þf}}, [[dative]] {{þgf}} and [[genitive]] {{ef}}, depending on what is happening to the word in the sentence. Different [[prepositions]] and [[verbs]] cause the noun to use a particular case. The default case is the nominative case.

If a word ends in a [[vowel]] in all [[cases]], its [[declension]] is said to be [[weak declension|weak]]. If a word ends sometimes in a [[consonant]], its declension is said to be [[strong declension|strong]]. Weak nouns have a more regular declension pattern, but both types do have [[sound shift]]s.
