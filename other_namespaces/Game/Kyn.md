__INDEX__
This game helps you learn the '''[[gender]]s''' of Icelandic [[noun]]s. 

Icelandic nouns can be a he {{kk}}, she {{kvk}}, or it {{hk}}. Although there are some patterns that you can rely on, it's usually not possible to know a word's gender just by looking at it. Instead, you learn it by seeing how it is used with other words.

== How to determine gender ==
To find the gender of the word "''hundur"'', we take a look at how it looks in the sentence "''hundurinn minn''" (meaning '''my dog''' or literally '''the dog of mine'''). The word "my" changes depending on the word's gender: `'''minn'''` {{kk}}, `'''mín'''` {{kvk}}, or `'''mitt'''` {{hk}}. "Minn" is masculine, so the word "dog" is masculine.
