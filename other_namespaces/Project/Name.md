The word "'''ylhýra'''" means "warm and affectionate", but now it is most commonly used as a part of an [[:w:allusion|allusion]] meaning "'''the Icelandic language'''".

That meaning comes from a poem written by [[:w:Jónas Hallgrímsson|Jónas Hallgrímsson]] in 1843. The poem goes like this: 
{{:Jónas Hallgrímsson/Ásta/1}}
This is a [[W:Romanticism|romanticist]] poem about the mother tongue, about how Jónas loves its warmth and affection.

Today, when someone says "`Norsku krakkarnir eru að syngja á okkar '''ástkæra ylhýra'''`", it is a poetic and somewhat humorous way of saying "The Norwegian kids are singing in Icelandic".
