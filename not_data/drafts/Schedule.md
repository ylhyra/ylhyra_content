= Beginner - Draft schedule =

*By LM- I’ll make red what is already there. Of course I have missed things and maybe some things are not necessary, feel free to add and alter. There would need to be a short description after each title.

I was not sure how many lessons or topics there would need to be every day or week, so I’ve stuck to around 5 per day for now. I don’t think it is feasible to do all those five lessons/topics in a day, every day, so we would need to either rename the days or spread the material out a bit more.

It would also be nice to have some indication of what kind of exercises would work best with each topic. I have tried to do this for the first day.*
