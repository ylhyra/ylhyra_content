Ég veit ekki '''alveg''' hvað ég er að gera.

==For how long?==
"Lengi" means "for a long time". The letters "[[Ng|'''ng''']]" cause an unexpected thing to occur when it comes to pronunciation: They cause the previous sound to want to be either ''[[í]]'' or ''[[ú]]'' (for a further explanation see [[Ng|here]]). [[e]] before ''[[ng]]'' is pronounced '''[[ei]]''' (remember that "ei" is itself pronounced as "eí", it ends in an ''[[í]]'' sound). "Lengi" is therefore pronounced {{pron|leíngi}}.

Notice how the phrase "how long" is created:

*'''Hvað''' ætlar þú að vera '''lengi'''? = "'''''What''' are you going to be '''for long'''?''" = '''For how long''' are you going to be?

==Nonchalance==
Það er '''nú''' gott.
