The word "'''ylhýra'''" means "warm and tender", but now it is most commonly used as a part of the [[w:allusion|allusion]] "''ástkæra ylhýra''", meaning "the Icelandic language".

It originates from a poem written by [[w:Jónas Hallgrímsson|Jónas Hallgrímsson]] in 1843, which goes like this:
{{:Jónas Hallgrímsson/Ásta/1}}
This is a [[W:Romanticism|romanticist]] poem about the mother tongue, about how Jónas loves its warm affection.

Today, when someone says "`Norsku krakkarnir eru að syngja á okkar '''ástkæra ylhýra'''`", it is a poetic and somewhat humorous way of saying "The Norwegian kids are singing in Icelandic".
