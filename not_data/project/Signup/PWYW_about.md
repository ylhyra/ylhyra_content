# Pricing

Ylhýra is free to use, but [[signup|creating an account]] allows you to save your vocabulary progress.

An Ylhýra account is available on a '''pay-what-you-want''' basis, meaning that it is completely up to you how much you pay. The recommended price is <Constant name="RECOMMENDED_PRICE_IN_US_DOLLARS"/> U.S.&nbsp;dollars. If you wish to pay nothing, you can.

If you have gotten more use out of Ylhýra than you expected when you signed up, you can also [[donate]] later on.
