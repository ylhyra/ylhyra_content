# Collaborate

Ylh√Ωra is a collaborative project and encourages submissions of new material and suggestions for improvements. You are also free to [[W:Fork (software development)|fork]] the non-third-party part of the site and republish on your own site. [mailto:ylhyra@ylhyra.is '''Send us an email'''] to get started.

## Other languages

If you're interested in creating coursework or flashcards for other language pairs than Icelandic to English, we can help you set such a project up.
