# Vocabulary game

This is a simple flaschard-based vocabulary game. After rating how well you know terms, you will be shown the difficult terms frequently until they begin to stick in memory.

An explanation of what you should expect from the buttons:
* "Bad" is for cards that you didn't know, didn't know perfectly, or had to think hard about. Clicking "Bad" will show you the card again in your current session, showing it after you've gone through three other cards. It will also schedule the card to be seen the next day.
* "Good" is for terms you knew perfectly but which you had to think a little bit about. Clicking "Good" will not show it again in your current session.
  * If this is the first time you see this card, it will be scheduled to be seen in two days.
  * Otherwise the card's previous time interval will be doubled. Always clicking "Good" will therefore show a card in 2 days, then 4 days, then 8, 16 and so on.
* "Easy" is for terms that are far too easy for you.
  * If this is the first time you see this card, it will be scheduled to be seen in 20 days.
  * Otherwise the card's previous time interval will be multiplied by 6. Always clicking "Easy" will therefore show a card in 20 days, then 4 months, then 2 years.

You will in most cases only use the "Bad" and "Good" buttons.

## Time

Each session lasts 5 minutes; the progess can be seen in the progress bar at the bottom of your screen. The timer will automatically stop when there's no activity from the user, so you can easily step away from the session.
