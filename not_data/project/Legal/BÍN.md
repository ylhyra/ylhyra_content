## About the inflection tables

Ylhýra's inflection tables are from the ''[https://bin.arnastofnun.is/DMII/ The Database of Icelandic Morphology]'' (better known as '''BÍN''') by the [[w:Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies|Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]]. The author and editor of the database is [https://www.arnastofnun.is/is/stofnunin/starfsfolk/kristin-bjarnadottir Kristín Bjarnadóttir].

Ylhýra only shows inflection examples that are considered to be standard Icelandic. Non-standard and colloquial inflections can be found by searching [https://bin.arnastofnun.is/ BÍN].

BÍN's original inflection forms are shown, with the addition of [[helper words]] and highlights of irregular inflections.

BÍN's data and the derived tables are published under the <b class="nobreak">[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ CC BY-SA 4.0]</b> license. See [https://github.com/ylhyra/icelandic-inflections here] for accessing the tables via an API.
