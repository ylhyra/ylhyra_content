# Privacy policy

The amount of data Ylhýra collects is limited and is not sold to a third party nor used for marketing purposes.

Ylhýra logs which pages you have read for internal analytics regarding an article's popularity. The country you are accessing the site from is logged alongside your browser's preferred language, but your IP address is not logged.

### Third parties

Ylhýra is stored behind Cloudflare's content delivery network. Cloudflare may log which pages you access and your IP address.

PayPal is used for payment processing. Your real name, email, and billing country are by default attached to your PayPal transaction; that information is accessible to Ylhýra but will not be used for any purpose except for handling billing and calculating taxes (value-added-tax or sales tax).

Mailinator is used for email newsletters. Newsletters are opt-in.
