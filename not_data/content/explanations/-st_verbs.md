Certain Icelandic [[verbs]] have another form that ends in '''-st''', such as "að komast", "að giftast", and "að sjást". If you look the [https://inflections.ylhyra.is/ inflection tables] of these words you will see them labeled as the "[[w:Middle voice|middle voice]]" (''miðmynd'').

A verb having -st usually indicates one of the following:

*that something is becoming done
*that something is able to be done
*that something is being done to itself
*that the subjects are doing something to each other

Examples:

*„Kakan er að '''bakast'''“ (The cake is being baked). Shows that the thing in the process of being done.
*„Við '''sjáumst''' á morgun“ (We will see each other tomorrow). Shows that the two things will do something to each other.
*„Við '''sjáumst''' ekki í myrkrinu“ (We cannot be seen in the dark). Discusses whether something is able to be done.
*„Ég '''kemst''' í gömlu buxurnar mínar“ (I am able to fit into my old pants). Discusses whether something is able to be done.
*„Ég '''kemst''' ekki í afmælið þitt“ (I am not able to make it to your birthday party). Discusses whether something is able to be done.
*„Þau '''kysstust''' þegar þau '''sáust'''“ (They kissed each other when they saw each other). Shows that the two people do something to each other.
*„Hvað er að '''gerast'''?“ (What is happening?) Shows that the thing in the process of being done.

***

Note that there may be ambiguity about whether something is actually an -st variant or just a form that happens to end in -st in one particular case but not all the related cases. See here:

* ég kom í gær (I came yesterday), þú kom'''st''' í gær (you came yesterday), hann kom í gær (he came yesterday). This is just the regular verb in the [[Active voice|regular voice]] despite the fact that one case, [[Second person|second person]] [[singular]] [[Past tense|past tense]], does happen to end in -st. This usually only happens with [[Second person|second person]] [[singular]] [[Past tense|past tense]]. 
* ég kom'''st''' í gær (I was able to come yesterday), þú kom'''st''' í gær (you were able to come yesterday), hann kom'''st''' í gær (he was able to come yesterday). This is truly the -st form of the verb, all of the related words end in -st.

This ambiguity is very rare, and you can almost always figure out what is meant from context.

'''Notes'''

You might be interested in knowing ''why'' these words end in `-st`, but if you're not you can ignore this section. The explanation is as follows:

In English, you can say: “He '''calls himself''' John”. The same can be done in Icelandic: “Hann '''kallar sig''' Jón”. “Himself” and “sig” are called ''reflexive'' because they imply something is happening to itself. A very long time ago, the '''[[sig]]''' was added to the verb, and that slowly became '''`-st`'''. The meaning also changed a bit.

*Hann kallar '''sig''' Jón. → Hann kalla'''st''' Jón.
*''He calls '''himself''' John. → He is called John.''

*Hún klæddi '''sig'''. → Hún klæddi'''st'''.
*''She dressed '''herself'''. → She got dressed.''

*Hann brenndi '''sig'''. → Hann brenndi'''st'''.
*''He burned '''himself'''. → He got burned.''
