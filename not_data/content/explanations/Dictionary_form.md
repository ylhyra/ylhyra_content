## Dictionary form

For [[inflection|inflected]] words, only one form of a word is listed in dictionaries. When available, the form listed will be:

* [[Nouns]] – Shown in the [[nominative case]] (the first case) (nominative), [[singular]], without a [[definite article]].
* [[Adjective]]s – Shown in the [[masculine]], [[nominative case]] (the first case), [[singular]], [[strong declension]], [[positive degree]].
* [[Pronoun]]s – Shown in the [[masculine]], [[nominative case]] (the first case), [[singular]].
* [[Verb]]s – Shown in the [[infinitive]] form.<!--<note>Ylhýra lists verbs in the infinitive form with the infinitive marker "að" (e.g. "að koma"), while dictionaries will only list "koma".</note>-->
* [[Adverbs]] –  Shown in the [[positive degree]].

<notes>Since these rules are followed when possible, in some cases the form listed in dictionaries is a rarely seen one. One example is the uncommon form "[sumur](https://inflections.ylhyra.is/sumir/478783)" (singular, masculine) when "sumt" (singular, neuter) or "sumir/sumar/sum" (plural) are the main forms you will see.</notes>
