The Icelandic language has around 315,000 speakers, and almost all of them live in Iceland.<ref>[https://www.ethnologue.com/19/language/isl/ Ethnologue, 19th ed]. Numbers from 2015.</ref>

===Language relatives===
Icelandic is most closely related language is the [[w:Faroese language|Faroese language]], spoken in the [[w:Faroe Islands|Faroe Islands]] south-east of Iceland. Icelanders can't understand spoken Faroese, but they can read it and usually think that the Faroese vocabulary hilarious.

Icelandic is also related to the languages spoken in Scandinavia (Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish), but they are different enough that even though Icelanders learn Danish in school for 7 years, most are unable to read Danish comfortably.

All of these languages are descendants of the [[w:Old Norse language|Old Norse language]] spoken around the 9th to 13th century.

===Where Icelandic comes from===
Norwegian settlers started moving to Iceland at the end of the 9th century and brought the Old Norse language with them. Living in relative isolation in an island in the North Atlantic Ocean meant that there was limited contact with other languages.

Modern Icelandic is relatively similar to the Old Norse language spoken a thousand years ago, and even though the pronunciation has changed Icelanders can still read Old Norse literature relatively easily, which is something many Icelanders are proud of.

===Similarity to English===
Icelandic and English both [[w:Germanic languages|Germanic languages]] and share many similarities, especially regarding sentence structure. Many words look similar in Icelandic and English, both because they are distantly related, and because English [[w:List of English words of Old Norse origin|acquired some words from Old Norse]] around the 10th century such as "cake", "egg", "ugly", and "take".
==Is Icelandic difficult to learn?==

Becoming proficient in a new language does take a few years of practise, but Icelandic is not that much more difficult than most other languages. For a native English speaker, learning Icelandic will take:

*More time than learning Swedish, French, or Spanish
*A similar amount of time as learning Russian, Polish, Greek, or German
*Less time than learning Japanese, Chinese, or Arabic

In the long run, learning the vocabulary and grammar isn't that hard, the most difficult may be having the motivation or discipline to study a little bit every week for months, finding good learning material at the appropriate level, and consistenly using the language.
==How well could I survive in Iceland by only speaking English?==

Since English is currently the global language, Icelanders learn English at school and most are adequate at English, similar to the rest of Northwestern Europe. While it is possible to live in Iceland using English, it comes at the cost of not being able to integrate well into society.

==When will I become good at Icelandic?==

It should take a few weeks until you can comfortably greet people, several months for you to be able to chit chat out on the street, and a few years until you can take part in a heated argument with multiple people.

<!-- *LM: How far do we go with Ylhýra? I don't really understand whether this is meant as an overview of the different levels or a recommendation of what you should do. In the latter case, it should be very clear what Ylhýra offers in order to be able to do those things!*
*'''Starting out''' – You will be able to use a few words and standard phrases, introducing yourself and finding your way around. Focus on learning words and short phrases. Do not study the grammar for now. It is more important to use several words incorrectly than it is to know only a handful of words correctly.
*'''Beginner''' – You can describe yourself and things that interest you. You can hold a conversation when your conversation partner speaks slowly and clearly, and is willing to repeat some words for you. You can write very short letters, such as post cards. Now you can start listening to Icelandic songs and movies, attempting to catch some words. Finding a language partner to speak with regularly is vital. Slowly we will introduce you to a bit of grammar. Practice speaking slowly and become good at longer phrases.
*'''Intermediate''' – You start being able to describe situations and thoughts, and have short conversations with natives. Speak with a language partner regularly, and surround yourself with the language. Listen to radio shows in the mornings, read a little bit every day. Watch dubbed &amp; subtitled children’s television. We will introduce you with the more complicated parts of grammar, and more specialised vocabulary.
*'''Advanced''' – You read books with more ease, especially books without a complicated use of language. You can hold a sustained conversation even about topics which you are not particularly knowledgeable about. You can watch movies and TV and listen to the radio without subtitles or dubbing, and you are able to discuss the programmes you have watched or listened to with natives. You can write long texts about matters that interest you. More reading and hefty discussions with natives are recommended.
*'''Expert''' - You can read many books, even about technical or complicated matters. You can speak to natives with ease, even natives with an accent or people who are difficult to hear (for instance on the phone). You can write long texts about complicated matters, and adjust your writing and speaking to the audience in question.

We hope that with Ylhýra we can ease the pain of most of the difficulties that occur when learning a language, making it viable for you to study the language by yourself.

Students of Icelandic often encounter

If you are a tourist, knowing Icelandic is not ''necessary''. Being able to communicate with locals will mainly gather you respect, as people are interested in someone who is willing to attempt to learn their language. If you plan on living in Iceland for a while, learning the languages becomes a necessity. It is the only way to integrate well into the society.

You can indeed survive in Iceland by only communicating in English, however you

. However, you will always be a bit left out. The news is in Icelandic, your local friends will switch over to Icelandic when addressing each other.

For a student of Icelandic, it can be a bit tiring when the bartender switches over to English when he notices you stumbling on your order. Usually this is because they aren’t very used to encountering someone like you, and they are only attempting to be helpful. However, you absolutely must not give up in these situations. If you continue to speak your Icelandic, broken though it may be, the person you’re speaking to will get the hint.
