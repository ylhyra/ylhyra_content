==How to use this book==
This book contains Icelandic text with translations. By clicking on a word you can see its definition. <span class="only-mobile">Click twice to see the meaning of sentences.</span> The text will often be difficult, but by slowly reading through it, listening to the audio, and by checking the translation, all text should be manageable and mostly understandable. When you encounter grammatical features which seem to make no sense, just try to grasp the sentence the best you can, all oddities will be explained in later chapters.
