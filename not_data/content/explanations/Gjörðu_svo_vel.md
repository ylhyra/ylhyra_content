title: Gjörðu svo vel
---

<level a2/>

'''Gjörðu svo vel''' means "here you go" or "you're welcome". It's literal meaning is "do so well", using the [[imperative]] form.

There is one thing you must notice: This phrase is using "að gjöra", a completely outdated alternative form of the word "að gera" (to do). Nowadays you will never see the form "að gjöra" except when reading the Bible. If this phrase were using modern Icelandic, it would be "gerðu svo vel".

==Pronunciation==

"Gjörðu svo vel" is [[Slurring|slurred]], so it is pronounced /<u>gjössovel</u>/ (more slurring) or /<u>gjörrusovel</u>/ (speaking more clearly).
