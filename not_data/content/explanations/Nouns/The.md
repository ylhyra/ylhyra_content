The word "'''the'''" is known as the [[w:Definite article|definite article]]. In English it is a seperate word ("'''the''' house") but in Icelandic it is attached to the end of the relevant word ("hús'''ið'''").

Notice that there is no ''"a / an"'' in Icelandic:

{| class="wikitable"

!English
!Icelandic
|-
|Mary is '''an''' American.
|`María er Ameríkani.`
|-
|He is such '''a''' good dog.
|`Hann er svo góður hundur.`
|-
|This takes '''a''' long time.
|`Þetta tekur langan tíma.`
|}

And notice that the ''"the"'' can look quite different depending on the word it is attached to:

{| class="wikitable"
|+
!English
!Icelandic
|-
|'''The''' weather today is good.
|`Veðr'''ið''' í dag er gott.`
|-
|Why is '''the''' cat outside?
|`Af hverju er köttur'''inn''' úti?`
|-
|'''The''' bakery is open!
|`Bakarí'''ið''' er opið!`
|}

Again, the "the" comes at the end of words instead of at the front. The endings in `veðr'''ið'''` and `köttur'''inn'''` mean the exact same thing, they just signify "the". The "the" changed depending on the word's grammatical type ([[gender]] and [[case]]), which results in many possible endings. These are all the possible endings for "the":

:-inn -ið -inum -ins -num -an -una -unni -unnar -nar -unum -anna -inu -ins -in

You do not need to memorize these endings for now, but you do need to be aware of them.
