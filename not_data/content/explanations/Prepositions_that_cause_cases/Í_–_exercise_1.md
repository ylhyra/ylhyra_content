Several prepositions can cause either þolfall or þágufall depending on context.

*í + [[þolfall]] {{þf}} = going into something
*í + [[þágufall]] {{þgf}} = already inside something

A more general rule is that:

*Þolfall indicates that the subject is moving relative to the object.
*Þágufall indicates that the subject is '''not''' moving relative to the object.

Ég fór í _____ (úlpan) mína og fór svo út í búð í ______ (úlpan) minni.

Explanation:

*`Ég fór í úlpuna` ([[þolfall]]) means "I put my jacket on" because þolfall implies you are going into something. The subject is moving relative to the object, the object is static.
*`Ég fór í úlpunni` ([[þágufall]]) means "I went somewhere wearing my jacket" because þágufall implies you are already inside something. The subject is '''not''' moving relative to the object.
