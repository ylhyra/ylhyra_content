Purchasing Icelandic e-books is quite easy and it is relatively cheap for the value you get out of them as a student.

We highly recommend purchasing an e-book and an audiobook together and to use them together as a reading aid.

Note however that you will almost never encounter [[written Icelandic]] on a level below [[C1]]. Even childrens' books are written at a [[C1]] level and use difficult vocabulary and phrases. For that reason you may as well want to spend your time reading regular books.

There are [https://www.forlagid.is/voruflokkur/rafbaekur/ over 1,000 e-books] and [https://www.forlagid.is/voruflokkur/hljodbaekur-og-tonlist/app/ 300 downloadable audiobooks] available on the website of the publishing house Forlagið. All e-books can also be purchased through Amazon for the Kindle.

The following is a list of some recommended books where both the e-book and the audiobook are available for download.
