Icelandic [[nouns]] have four [[cases]]. Finding the correct form of the word is called '''declension'''. This is a simple declension table for the word ''lamb'':{{declension-singular| '''lamb'''|'''lamb'''|'''lambi'''|'''lambs'''}}
Nobody actually remembers this table by heart, instead people construct some sentence where only a particular case can fit, and see what their own sense of the language tells them.

The helper sentences you use for this are:

#''hér er'' = here is. This sentence will always need a word in the [[First case|first case]].
#''um'' = about. This word will always need a word in the [[Second case|second case]].
#''frá'' = from. This word will always need a word in the [[Third case|third case]].
#''til'' = to. This word will always need a word in the [[Fourth case|fourth case]].

And since the declension table is always shown in the same order, we fill in our table like so:{{declension-singular|hér er '''lamb'''|um '''lamb'''|frá '''lambi'''|til '''lambs'''}}
When declining words that are [[plural]], you switch "hér er" out with "hér er'''u'''":{{declension-singular|hér eru '''lömb'''|um '''lömb'''|frá '''lömbum'''|til '''lamba'''}}
