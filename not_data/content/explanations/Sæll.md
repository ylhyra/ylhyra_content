==Longer form==
The longer form of `s√¶ll` is either "be happy" or "be happy and blessed". Strangely enough, the order of "be" and "happy" can change whether it is thought of as a hello or a goodbye.

*'''Hello:'''
**`S√¶ll`
**`S√¶ll vertu`
**`Vertu s√¶ll og blessa√∞ur`
*'''Goodbye:'''
**`Vertu s√¶ll`
**`Vertu s√¶ll og blessa√∞ur`

==Plural==

===Using the plural to one person üòé===
If you're addressing a close friend and you want to seem cool and casual, you can say `s√¶lir` (the [[plural]] form) instead of `s√¶ll`. It makes it sound like you are addressing them like a group (or that you're talking down to them, as a joke of course).
