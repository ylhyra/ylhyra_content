'''''Kennitala''''' (meaning "identification number")<ref>''Kenna'' in this context doesn't mean "to teach", rather it's the very rare meaning of "to name someone for / to identify".</ref> is a unique number given to every individual and company in Iceland so that they can be identified in databases and when doing business. It is used practically everywhere: When you go to the bank, when you go to the mechanic, and even when you rent a film. The number is not a secret, anyone can look up what your ''kennitala'' is.

If you spend a long time in Iceland, you need to apply for a ''kennitala''.

A ''kennitala'' looks like this: 250592-3379. It encodes your date of birth, in this example the individual is born on 25 May 1992.
