Written Icelandic is much more formal than spoken Icelandic. In particular:

*The [[word order]] is often different
*It uses more antiquated words and phrases

## Word order
Switching the word order by placing the verb first can make your sentence sound much more formal.

*''Maðurinn datt. Hlaut hann tognun. –'' A normal sentence would be: „''Maðurinn datt. Hann hlaut tognun.“''

Newspapers drop certain words from the headlines:

*''Fylgjast grannt með. –'' A normal sentence would be: „''Þau fylgjast grannt með.''“

## Word use
Examples of words use you can only use in written language:

*''Það var snemma morguns '''er''' hann lagði af stað. –'' '''Er''' is not the verb "to be", instead it means "when".
