The letter '''O''' is pronounced <Audio src="969t.mp3" inline/>, like how British people say ''h'''o'''t'' or ''w'''a'''ter''.

It can be [[Long sound|long]]:<ref>For advanced students: The long O is pronounced by gliding from an O with a small mouth opening to an O with a larger mouth opening. You can think of the word "''opinn''" beging pronounced almost like "''{{Gray|w}}opinn''". While it is not necessary to do this gliding sound (Icelanders are not aware they make this sound), doing it can make you sound considerably better. It is better to exaggerate the length of the long sounds and to exaggerate this gliding sound rather than to do too little.</ref>

*'''o'''pinn, k'''o'''ma, s'''o'''nur, h'''o'''num, '''o'''f

Or [[short]]:

*'''o'''fn, '''o'''kkur, hamb'''o'''rgari, g'''o'''tt, kreditk'''o'''rt

The name of the letter is just "O".
