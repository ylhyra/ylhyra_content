title: S
---

The letter '''S''' is pronounced the same as in English ("'''''s'''ome, '''s'''ing''").<ref>There is a slight difference that some students notice, but native speakers are unable to notice any difference, so you don't have to worry about it. The tongue in the Icelandic S is a little bit more back than in English, and it touches the back of your [[w:Premolar|premolar]] teeth, so it can sound a little bit like the ''sh'' in "'''''sh'''y''" or a little bit whistle-like.</ref>

*'''s'''andur, ble'''ss''', '''s'''æll

The name of the letter is "ess", same as in English

***

There are a few other sounds in Icelandic that to many foreigners sound like an S but aren't. Those are:

#The [[Þ]] sound: '''þ'''annig, me'''ð'''
#The [[R|breathy R]] sound: góðu'''r''', '''hr'''att
#The [[L#Breathy L|breathy L]] sound: ve'''l''', '''hl'''ægja
