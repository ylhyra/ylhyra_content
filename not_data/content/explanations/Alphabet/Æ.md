title: Æ
---

The letter '''Æ''' is pronounced {{listen|audio=pGvG.mp3}}. It is not a single sound, but two sounds: "aí". You start by pronouncing the letter [[A]], and then you pronounce the letter [[Í]]. This is the same sound as in the English "''m'''y'''''".

It can be [[Long sound|long]]:

*s'''æ'''l, k'''æ'''rasti

Or [[short]]:

*s'''æ'''ll, n'''æ'''stur

The name of the letter is "æ". The [[w:Æ|symbol itself]] was originally a [[w:ligature|ligature]] of the letters "ae", but is now just a normal letter. If you [[Transcription|don't have access to an Icelandic keyboard]], you write the letter as "ae".
