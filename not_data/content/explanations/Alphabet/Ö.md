The letter '''Ö''' is pronounced <Audio src=" 3AF6.mp3" inline/>. It is similar to the English pronunciation of ''b'''i'''rd'' or ''n'''u'''rse''. This is a slightly tricky letter to get right, the following advice applies to most students: Try to make your mouth even more circle-shaped and pronounce the sound more forward in your mouth.

It can be [[short sound|short]]:

*mist'''ö'''k, j'''ö'''rðin, b'''ö'''rn

Or [[Long sound|long]]:

*mj'''ö'''g, '''ö'''murlegt, f'''ö'''rum

When it is long, it is pronounced in a long gliding fashion, sort of going from ''[[u]]'' to ''ö''. You can imagine words like "mjög" being written "mjuöög". Exaggerating the length of this sound is much better than doing it too short.

If the [[Ng and nk rule|next letter is ''ng'' or ''nk'']], it is pronounced like '''''[[au]]''''' (which is itself pronounced as "öí") <Audio src="8aNv.mp3" inline/>:

*löng (/löíng/), bönkum (/böínkum/)

The name of the letter is "ö".
