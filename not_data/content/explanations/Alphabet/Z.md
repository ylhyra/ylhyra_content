The letter '''Z''' (`zeta`) was previously used in words like `Ã­slenzka`, but in 1973 the Icelandic spelling rules were simplified and "z" was mostly changed to "s" since they had the exact same pronunciation. You will still see some Zs around in old text and in writings from a few respectable yet eccentric people.
