The letter '''M''' can either represent a normal M sound or a breathy M sound. 

==Normal M==
In normal situations, M has the same sound as the English M. 

*'''m'''a'''mm'''a, u'''m''', '''m'''agi

==Breathy M==
The breathy M sound is pronounced without using the voice. You pronounce it by closing your lips like in a normal M, and then blowing air out of your nose with your mouth closed. In English, it is the sound you make when you do a strong "'''''h'''mm''".

It appears in the following situations:<ref>It also appears when the next letter is a '''k''' such as in the words "rýmka, meðaumkun", but that's an extremely rare letter cluster so it is not worth thinking about.</ref>

*When the next letter is a '''p''':
**la'''m'''pi, sva'''m'''pur, sja'''m'''pó
*When the next letter is a '''t''':
**fi'''mm'''ti, ske'''mm'''tilegur

The name of the letter is "emm", same as in English.
