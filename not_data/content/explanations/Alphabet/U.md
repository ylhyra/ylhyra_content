The letter '''U''' is pronounced <Audio src="-H8G.mp3" inline/>. This sound doesn't exist in English, but if you start with the '''''i''''' sound in ''k'''i'''d'' and then make your lips round, you will get the Icelandic '''''u'''''.

Or [[short]]:

*vin'''u'''r, k'''u'''nna, t'''u'''tt'''u'''g'''u'''

If the [[Ng and nk rule|next letter is ''ng'' or ''nk'']], it is pronounced like '''''[[ú]]''''':

*þ'''u'''ngur ({{pron|þúngur}}), p'''u'''nktur ({{pron|púnktur}})

The name of the letter is "u".
