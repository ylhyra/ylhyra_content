The letter '''i''' is pronounced similar to the English ''k'''i'''d''. The Icelandic letter ''[[y]]'' has the exact same pronunciation.

It can be [[Long sound|long]]:

*v'''i'''nur, m'''i'''sjafn, b'''i'''l

Or [[short]]:

*v'''i'''nna, '''i'''nn'''i''', p'''i'''lla

If the [[Ng and nk rule|next letter is ''ng'' or ''nk'']], it is pronounced like '''''[[í]]''''':

*fingur ({{pron|fíngur}}), klink ({{pron|klínk}})

There is an important word that, unintuitively, follows the above rule. That is the word "vinkona" (pronounced /vínkona/). This is unintuitive because the ''nk'' rule doesn't otherwise apply across word boundaries (the word vinkona is made up of two words, vin-kona).

The name of the letter is "i".
