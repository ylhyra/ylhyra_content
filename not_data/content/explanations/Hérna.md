{{start|Hérna}}

`Hérna` is the most common pause-word. It literally means "here", but in this context it just means "uhh, ehh, er, uhm".

*{{listen|audio=DzeR.mp3}} `Ég veit ekki alveg, '''hérna''', hvenær þetta verður búið.`
*{{listen|audio=gU6M.mp3}} `Og hún, '''hérna''', sagði bara nei.`
*{{listen|audio=581W.mp3}} `[[Heyrðu]], ég er, '''hérna''', að halda, '''hérna''', partí, '''hérna''', á sunnudaginn.`
**Note that this example is not an exaggeration, many people do put this many pauses in their sentences when they are trying to find the words. Icelanders do not notice ''hérna'' any more than English speakers notice ''uhh''s.

Hérna can also be used to start new timid sentences, "uhh so...":

*{{listen|audio=BR_j.mp3}} `'''Hérna''', er þessi Ívar frændi þinn?`

You should always try to use ''hérna'' instead of "uhh" when you forget a word in Icelandic. Remember that it is pronounced /hyedna/ and '''not''' /hyerdna/.
