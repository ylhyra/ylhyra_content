[[Vowels]] in Icelandic can either be long or short. The long vowels take a slightly longer time to pronounce than the short vowels<note>About 25 to 70% longer.</note> and you often glide a bit into the long vowels. "K'''o'''ma" ("to come") is long, but "k'''o'''mma" ("a comma") is short. "V'''i'''nur" ("friend") is long but "v'''i'''nnur" ("works") is short.

The difference between a long and a short vowel is very small, and students usually find it difficult to distinguish between them. Students also tend to underestimate how long the long vowels are, and so they might pronounce "vinur" and "vinnur" the exact same way. It is much better to exaggerate the length of the long vowels. Exaggerating the difference makes it much easier to understand you. You can imagine "vinur" being written as "viiinur".

The rules are:

*A vowel is '''long''' if it has [[stress]]<ref name=":0">Stress can only be on the first syllable of a word (or the first syllable of a sub-word in a [[compound word]]).</ref> and is followed by one [[consonant]] or no consonants.<note>In [[compound words]] this rule applies to each sub-word, for example "útlönd" is made up of "út-lönd", "'''ú'''t" only has one consonant so it is long.</note>
**v'''i'''nur, b'''a'''ka, l'''æ'''ra, þ'''á''', tr'''é''', s'''o'''fa, þ'''a'''k, '''ú'''tlönd (út-lönd), g'''ó'''ð, '''a'''fi
*A vowel is '''short''' if it doesn't have [[stress]]<ref name=":0" /> or if it's followed by two or more [[Consonant|consonants]] (like "mm", "skt", or "kk").
**v'''i'''nn'''u'''r, b'''a'''kka, l'''æ'''rð'''i''', b'''o'''rð'''a''', t'''a'''kk, g'''o'''tt, f'''i'''sk'''u'''r, '''a'''mm'''a''', '''e'''lst'''u'''r

== Gliding ==
There is another trick you can use to perfect your pronunciation. Long vowels are not static, instead they glide a bit into a fully open mouth. In English, when you pronounce the sad trombone sound "wah-wah", you start with your mouth closed in the "w" and glide into the fully open-mouthed "ah".

When you see a long vowel, try to both exaggerate its length and also exaggerate the amount of gliding you do, going from a closed mouth to an open mouth. Over-exaggerating it sounds better than not doing enough:

* "mjög" is pronounced "mj(u)öööög"
* "er" is pronounced "(i)eeeer"
* "kom" is pronounced "k(u)oooom"

<notes>
*A note to German speakers: The gliding in Icelandic long vowels may sound similar to German words that end in an "r". "De" in Icelandic might sound like a German "de'''r'''". Icelanders however don't perceive an "r" in long vowels.
