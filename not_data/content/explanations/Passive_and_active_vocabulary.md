Your '''passive vocabulary''' consists of the words you understand, while your '''active vocabulary''' consists of the words you're able to use yourself.

Your passive vocabulary is always much larger than your active vocabulary. You can train your passive vocabulary by reading, watching films, and going through [[flashcards]]. You can train your active vocabulary by going through flashcards, having long conversations with others, and writing essays.
