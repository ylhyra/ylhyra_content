'''Adjectives''' (lýsingarorð) are the words that describe things, such as ''interesting'', ''funny'', and ''difficult''.

Adjectives need to have the same [[gender]], [[case]], and [[Plural|number]] as the [[noun]] they describe. For that reason, adjectives has far more possible [[Declension|declensions]] than nouns, there is a different one for each gender it describes.

Adjectives also exist in three different forms based on whether they are comparing things (degree of comparison):

#The regular form,<ref>„Frumstig“</ref> such as "good"
#The form you use when comparing things (comparative form),<ref>„Miðstig“</ref> such as "better"
#The form when something the greatest or most of something (superlative form),<ref>„Efsta stig“</ref> such as "best"

There is yet another thing that complicates adjectives. They have two different conjugation forms:

*[[Strong declension]]. Exists for the regular form ("good") and the superlative form ("best"), but not the comparative form ("better"). This is the default declension form of the the regular form of adjectives.
**`hér er góðu'''r''' maður` – Ends in a consonant, this is a strong declension.
*[[Weak declension]]. Exists for all three degrees of comparison (regular ("good"), comparative ("better"), and superlative ("best")). For the regular form, this usually happens because the noun has a [[Definite article|definite article]].
**`hér er góð'''i''' maður'''inn'''` – Ends in a vowel in this case and in all cases, this is a weak declension.
