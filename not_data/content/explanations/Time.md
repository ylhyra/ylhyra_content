{{start|Time}}

To talk about time in Icelandic, you talk about the '''''clock''''':

*Hvað er klukkan? = What is the clock?
*Klukkan er tvö. = The clock is two.
*Ég kem klukkan tvö. = I will come at two o'clock.

Note that the word klukka is [[feminine]] {{kvk}} but the number is [[neuter]] {{hk}}. This is a very illogical, since in all other situations the [[gender]] of the [[number]] has to be the same as the gender of the [[noun]].{{efn|The reason for this inconsistency is unclear, possible explanations include:<ref>[https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2012 Hvers vegna er sagt: "klukkan er eitt, tvö eða þrjú," alltaf í hvorugkyni, en ekki í kvenkyni úr því að klukkan er kvenkynsorð?], ''Vísindavefurinn'', Guðrún Kvaran, 2001.</ref>
* The phrase may be influenced by [[w:Danish|Danish]]. 
* The phrase may be referring to "the clock has three '''beats'''" (beat is a [[neuter]] word) and the last word may just have disappeared.}}

==Hálf==

In English, 09:30 is "half <u>past</u> nine" but in Icelandic it is "half ten", which may be confusing at first.

*11:30 – hálf tólf
*07:30 – hálf átta
*04:30 – hálf fimm
*09:30 – hálf tíu

==Minutes and quarters==
For everything else, there is "yfir" and "í".

*12:15 – korter yfir tólf
*12:05 – fimm mínútur yfir tólf
*11:55 – fimm mínútur í tólf
*11:45 – korter í tólf

==AM/PM==
Iceland does not use AM/PM, instead time is written in a 24 hour format<ref group="lower-alpha">May either be written with a dot (15.30, more common in newspapers and recommended by many style guides) or a colon (15:30, more common with the general populace).</ref> but spoken about in "during the day/evening/night/morning".

==Very uncommon ways to talk about time==
<level c1/>

You do not need to know the following words, but you might hear them in formal speech:

*''vantar'' ("is lacking") – This is common to hear on the radio, but not in normal speech.
**''Klukkuna vantar fimm mínútur í tvö.'' = It is five minutes to two. 
***In normal speech you would say ''Klukkan er fimm mínútur í tvö.''
*''ganga'' ("to walk") – This is sometimes used by older speakers.
**''Klukkan er að ganga tvö.'' = The time is anywhere between 01:01 and 01:59.
