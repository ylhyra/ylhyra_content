= How to use Ylhýra =

Ylhýra contains Icelandic text with translations. By clicking on a word you can see its definition. The text will often be difficult, but by slowly reading through it, listening to the audio, and by checking the translation, all text should be manageable and mostly understandable. When you encounter grammatical features which seem to make no sense, just try to grasp the sentence the best you can, all oddities will be explained in later chapters.
