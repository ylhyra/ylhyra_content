{{start|Linguistic purism}}
{{under construction}}
The period of Romanticism swept Europe in the 1800s. Glorification of nature and the past was a popular theme, which is exactly what happened in Iceland. Love for nature, love for the heroic sagas of the Vikings, and love for the language all kindled patriotism. Foreign influences on the language were stamped out, especially Danish and Latin influences. This practice is called linguistic purism and is to this day very popular in Iceland. Although foreign slang or loan words are sometimes used colloquially (nowadays most often from English), it is considered hideous to do so in written language. So, instead of adopting words from Latin or English, Icelanders create their own words for most new concepts. A robot is vélmenni (mechanical-man), a helicopter is þyrla (a whirler), mathematics is stærðfræði (the study of sizes). Learning such words can be a bit annoying, but it is usually not too much of a difficulty.
