## Þú

If the word `þú` ("you") comes directly after a verb (such as in [[questions]]: "Are you?"), `þú` is usually merged with the verb. This only happens with the word form `þú` and not any of its other cases (such as `þig`).

The rules are:

* If the verb ends in a "t" or an "ð", just add a "u":
  * ert + þú → ertu
  * kemst + þú → kemstu
  * fórst + þú → fórstu
  * ferð + þú → ferðu
* Otherwise, add a "ðu":
  * kemur + þú → kemurðu
  * ætlar + þú → ætlarðu

Notice that the "ð" in the words "kemurðu" and "ætlarðu" **isn't** pronounced, it is just {{pron|kemuru}} and {{pron|ætlaru}}. The "ð" is however pronounced in "farðu" since the original verb includes it.

If you want to emphasize "þú", you don't have to merge these words.

## Þið

A similar thing regarding pronunciation happens when the word form `þið` is behind a verb: "Eruð þið" is pronounced {{pron|eruði}} and "fóruð þið" is pronounced {{pron|fóruði}}. However, the words are just written seperately.<note>Some people do write them as "fóruði", but it is non-standard.</note>
