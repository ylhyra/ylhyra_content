The way to politely ask for things in Icelandic is with "Can I get ...?". The word for "to get" is "'''að fá'''" but the word "can" makes it radically alter its form (see the article on the [[Supine|past participle]] for the reason why) so the result is "Get ég '''fengið''' ...? ''Fá'' and ''fengið'' are the same word, just with a different form. [https://inflections.ylhyra.is/f%C3%A1/464090 Click here] to see the full table of conjugation for this word.

So:

*Get ég fengið hamborgara? (Can I get a hamburger?)
*Get ég fengið kaffi? (Can I get some coffee?)
*Get ég fengið fisk? (Can I get fish?)
*Get ég fengið tvo bjóra? (Can I get two beers?)

The word you're asking for has to be placed into the [[second case]].
***

English speakers have a tendency to incorrectly ask for things with "má ég fá ...?" because they are directly translating the English phrase "may I get ...?". But "má ég" can usually not be used in this context, "má ég" means "do I have permission to" and so is mostly used to ask permission from an authority figure. For example, you might use it to ask for permission from your parents.

*Mamma, má ég fá nammi? (Mom, am I allowed to get some candy?)
*Mamma, get ég fengið nammi? (Mom, could you please hand me some candy?)
