{{start|Difficulty scale}}
The difficulty scale we use is the European language proficiency scale, known as [[w:CEFR|CEFR]]. Language proficiency is graded from the lowest to the highest level: '''A1''', '''A2''', '''B1''', '''B2''', '''C1''', and '''C2'''. It is widely used in European countries and therefore offers a good common ground when talking to other language learners, when choosing language-learning material, and for knowing where you stand.
