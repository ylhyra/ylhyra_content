`Góðan daginn` (“Good day”) is a very common greeting, used from early morning until 6PM (that's when the day turns into an evening). You use it:

* To say "good morning" to your family members when you wake up.
* To greet strangers you meet on the street.
* To greet waiters, bartenders, and other staff.
* To greet your customers.

Notice that the phrase is using the [[second case]] rather than the [[first case]] as one would assume. It makes sense if you think of the phrase as being a shortened version of "(I hope you have) a good day".
