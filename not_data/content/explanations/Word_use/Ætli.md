The word ‚Äû[[√Ütla|a√∞ √¶tla]]‚Äú usually means "to intend, to plan to". In old Icelandic it also had the alternative meaning of "to believe / to assume" which is today only used to say "I wonder if". Students usually find it to be a bit counter-intuitive, but learning it well is worth it.

==√Ütli ...?==
Have a look at this sentence:

*`√Ütli √æ√∫ viljir koma √≠ heims√≥kn?`

''√Ütli'' is in the [[subjunctive]] form, showing that this is a hypothetical situation. √Ütli therefore means "should it be assumed?" or "I wonder if?". The sentence can be translated as any of the following:

*Should it be assumed that you want to come for a visit?
*Do you suppose you want to come over for a visit?
*I was wondering if you wanted to come over for a visit?

Using ''√¶tli'' in this way is quite common. It is a polite way to suggest something to someone, or a polite way to say "I wonder if?". Instead of asking someone directly if they want something, we say that we were wondering if it should be assumed that they want something ‚Äì it is therefore much less presumptuous and is useful when you don't want to impose on someone else.

More examples:

*`√Ütli kakan s√© tilb√∫in?` ‚Äì I wonder if the cake is ready. / Do you suppose the cake is ready?
*`Af hverju √¶tli h√∫n s√© √≠ svona vondu skapi?` ‚Äì I wonder why she's in such a bad mood.
*`√Ütli sundlaugin s√© opin?` ‚Äì Do you suppose the pool is open?
*`√Ütli √©g geti komi√∞ og s√≥tt s√≠mann minn √° eftir?` ‚Äì I was wondering if I could come and fetch my telephone later.

==√Ütli √æa√∞ ekki.==

Related to the above, there also exists the possibility to ask questions with the word ''ekki'', similar to the English:

*Would'''n't''' you like to come?
*Would'''n't''' that be nice?
*Do'''n't''' you think this is a bit much?

Certain sentences on this form (such as "Wouldn't that be nice?") are rhetorical questions that don't require an answer.

Think a bit about what the difference between the following is:

*√Ütli √æ√∫ viljir koma √≠ heims√≥kn?
*√Ütli √æ√∫ viljir '''ekki''' koma √≠ heims√≥kn?

The difference is:

*√Ütli √æ√∫ viljir koma √≠ heims√≥kn? ‚Äì "I was wondering if you wanted to come over for a visit?"
**This is a polite, unassuming offer. It is rather timid. An emoji equivalent would be ü•∫
*√Ütli √æ√∫ viljir '''ekki''' koma √≠ heims√≥kn? ‚Äì "Don't you think you want to come over for a visit?"
**This is also polite, but it is more presumptuous (in a friendly manner) than the above. The default answer for the respondent is "yes". Emoji equivalents would be ü§†üòé

Sentences that use "√¶tli ... ekki" can mean any of the following:

*I guess that ...
*It's likely that ...
*Don't you think that ...
*Wouldn't you ...

When used to mean "I guess that...", it implies that you're shrugging your shoulders, the tone is somewhat defeatist.

By far the most common sentence that uses this form is:

*`√Ütli √æa√∞ ekki.` ‚Äì "I guess so."

It means "Should that not be assumed?". This is a rhetorical question ‚Äì the implied answer is "yes that should be assumed". The sentence is therefore an implied statement of fact, and the meaning of the sentence is "I guess so."

Examples:

*Hvar er G√≠sli? ‚Äì √Ütli hann s√© ekki enn √∫ti me√∞ hundinn.
**Where is G√≠sli? ‚Äì I guess he's still outside with the dog.
*√Ütli √æa√∞ v√¶ri ekki √≥d√Ωrara a√∞ kaupa √°rskort? ‚Äì J√∫, √∂rugglega.
**Wouldn't you assume that it would be cheaper to buy a year's pass? ‚Äì Yes, probably.
