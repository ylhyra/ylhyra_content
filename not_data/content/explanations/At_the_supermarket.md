= At the supermarket =

Since you will go to the store multiple times a week, you’ll get very comfortable at repeating this formulaic interaction:

<conversation>

:Góðann daginn! - Góðan dag 😊 Viltu '''poka'''? - Já takk. Þetta verða þá 2.000 krónur. Viltu '''kvittun'''? - Nei takk.

</conversation>

Practice this conversation a few times. It’s all right if you don’t know the numbers, the final amount will be shown on the cashier’s computer display.

There are two common ways of asking if you want the receipt:

* `Viltu kvittun?` - Do you want a receipt?
* `Viltu afritið?` - Do you want the copy? <!-- - `Viltu strimilinn?` - Do you want the strip of paper? -->

The Icelandic service industry doesn’t really put an emphasis on superfluous politeness like you may know from America. However, you might sometimes hear some variation of ''“Have a nice day!”'' here. This practice is new, imported by business owners who have studied abroad, and strikes many Icelanders as a very unnatural way of ending a conversation. But most are just happy that someone is wishing them a good day.
