{{a1|type=explanation}}

There are four [[cases]] in Icelandic. The '''second case''' in the [[declension table]] is known as the "accusative case".<ref>On Ylhýra we refer to it as the "second case" for simplicity's sake since you will always see these four cases listed in the same order in the [[declension table]].<br />
In Icelandic the first case is called '''þolfall''' and is abbreviated as '''þf.''' Þolfall literally means "suffering/enduring case". The English name "accusative" means "having been blamed" in Latin.</ref> It shows that the word is having something done to it.

The [[helper word]] you use to force a word into the second case is „um“ ("about").

==Things that cause the second case==
The following [[prepositions]] always [[Prepositions that cause cases|cause]] the second case:

*um (about)
*gegnum (through)
*kringum (around)

And these prepositions can either cause the second or the [[third case]] depending on context (click [[Prepositions that cause cases|here]] to see the difference):

*á (onto)
*eftir (after)
*fyrir (for)
*í (into)
*með (with)
*undir (under)
*við (by)
*yfir (over)

The majority of [[Cases caused by verbs|verbs cause the second case]]. Among common verbs that do so are:
