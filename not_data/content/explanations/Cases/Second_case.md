# Accusative case – the second case

There are four [[cases]] in Icelandic. The second case in the [[declension table]] is the '''accusative case'''.<note>Known as '''þolfall''' in Icelandic, abbreviated as '''þf.'''</note><note>A way to remember this word is to think that if someone is "accused", then there is some action that is happening to them.<br/>Þolfall literally means "suffering/enduring case".</note> It shows that the word is having something done to it.

The [[helper word]] you use to force a word into the second case is „um“ ("about").

## Things that cause the accusative case
The accusative case is very common, especially for words that come after verbs. The vast majority of [[Cases caused by verbs|verbs cause the accusative case]]. Some common verbs that do so are:

*að eiga (to own)
*að hafa (to have)
*að tala (to speak)
*að geta (to be able to)
*að vilja (to want)

The following [[prepositions]] always [[Prepositions that cause cases|cause]] the accusative case:

*um (about)
*gegnum (through)
*kringum (around)

And these prepositions can either cause the accusative case (the second case) or the [[dative case]] (the third case) depending on context (click [[Prepositions that cause cases|here]] to see the difference):

*á (onto)
*eftir (after)
*fyrir (for)
*í (into)
*með (with)
*undir (under)
*við (by)
*yfir (over)
