# Introduction to cases

[[Noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, and [[pronoun]]s change their form depending on what's happening to them in a sentence. There are four such **[[cases]]** in Icelandic. In this chapter we'll have a look at the first two cases of one common pattern – the "kona" pattern.

The **[[first case]]**<note>Known as the *nominative case* / *nefnifall*.</note> is used when the word is the main word in the sentence<note>It's the *subject* of the sentence – the word that is doing something.</note> or when we're describing something as *being*.

The **[[second case]]**<note>Known as the *accusative case* / *þolfall*.</note> indicates that the word is having something done to it. As a general rule, you should use this case if there's a verb that describes what's happening to it. A major exception is that "to be" causes the first case.

Comparing the above to English: In the sentence "*she* took *her*", both "she" and "her" are the same word but have different forms to indicate what is happening to it. "She" is the subject of the sentence and would therefore use the Icelandic first case, while "her" is the object of the sentence and would use the Icelandic second case in this context.
