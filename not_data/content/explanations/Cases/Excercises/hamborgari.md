Getting a feel for the [[Cases|four cases]] of Icelandic does take some time, but through repitition it becomes second nature. These are the four cases for the word "my hamburger" (literally "the hamburger of mine"). You can [https://inflections.ylhyra.is/hamborgari click here] to all the case tables for the word. Notice that the basic word is just "hamborgari", the additional "-nn" means "[[Definite article|''the'']]" (known as the [[definite article]]). The reason we add "the" to the word is that to say "my hamburger" you have to say "'''the''' hamburger of mine" (see [[My|here]] for a further explanation).{{declension-singular|hér er '''hamborgari<u>nn</u> minn'''|um '''hamborgara<u>nn</u> minn'''| frá '''hamborgara<u>num</u> mínum'''| til '''hamborgara<u>ns</u> míns'''}}
The words "[[Helper words for declension|hér er, um, frá, til]]" are not a part of the sentence "my hamburger", instead they are [[Helper words for declension|helper words]] that we use to create the four items in the table. Speakers of Icelandic are not able to see a word and immediately tell you, for example, how the word is in the [[third case]]. Instead they have to generate a sentence (such as here "'''from''' my hamburger") that forces the word into the correct form — since the speaker has an innate feel for sentence structure the brain places it into the correct form, but the brain has no concept of a word being the third case or something else.

In this exercise, you will place the word "my hamburger" into the correct form. These are the rules you need to know for this exercise:

*'''er''' ('''að vera''') (to be) causes the [[first case]]
*'''að vilja''' (to want) causes the [[second case]]
*'''að borða''' (to eat) causes the [[second case]]
*'''á''' (onto) causes the [[second case]] if the thing is moving to the other thing
*'''á''' (on) causes the [[third case]] if the thing is already on the other thing

You do not need to memorize these for now, instead what you should do is that for each problem below you should scroll up and see what case you should choose, then look at the table of cases above, and then try to make it fit into your sentence.
***

Þetta er ______. (This is my hamburger).

<Collapse>
Þetta er '''hamborgarinn minn'''. {{nf}}

The word "er" causes the first case, so here we use the first case.
</Collapse>
***

Vilt þú ______? (Do you want my hamburger?)

<Collapse>
Vilt þú '''hamborgarann minn'''? {{þf}}

The word "vilja" causes the second case.
</Collapse>
***

Ég ætla að setja ost á ______. (I am going to put cheese onto my hamburger)

<Collapse>
Ég ætla að setja ost á '''hamborgarann minn'''. {{þf}}

Here there is movement from the cheese to the hamburger. Because there is movement, the word "á" causes the second case.
</Collapse>
***

Það er ostur á ______. (There is cheese on my hamburger)

<Collapse>
Það er ostur á '''hamborgaranum mínum'''. {{þgf}}

Here there is '''no''' movement, the cheese is staying still on the hamburger. Because there is no relative movement, the word "á" causes the third case.
</Collapse>
***

Ég ætla að borða ______. (I am going to eat my hamburger)

<Collapse>
Ég ætla að borða '''hamborgarann minn'''. {{þf}}

The word "borða" causes the second case.
</Collapse>
***

Af hverju er ______ svona góður? (Why is my hamburger so good?)

<Collapse>
Af hverju er '''hamborgarinn minn''' {{nf}} svona góður?

The word "er" causes the first case.
