There are four [[cases]] in Icelandic. The '''third case''' in the [[declension table]] is known as the "dative case".<note>On Ylhýra we refer to it as the "third case" for simplicity's sake since you will always see these four cases listed in the same order in the [[declension table]].

In Icelandic the first case is called '''þágufall''' and is abbreviated as '''þgf.''' Þágufall literally means "receiving case". The English name "dative" means "appropriate for giving" in Latin.</note> It shows that the word has something or is being given something.

The [[helper word]] you use to force a word into the third case is „frá“ ("from").
