# Nominative case <small>– the first case</small>

There are four [[cases]] in Icelandic. The first case in the [[declension table]] is the '''nominative case''' (''nefnifall, nf.'').<note>You can remember this word by remembering that "nominative" means "related to naming", as in the related word "nominate". The word that is being named is the main word of the sentence.<br/>The same applies to Icelandic where "nefnifall" means "naming case".</note> It is the default case for a word. The main word of the sentence (the subject, the word that is doing something) is usually always in the nominative case.

The [[Helper word|helper words]] you use to force a word into the first case is „hér er“ ("here is").

Verbs that [[Cases caused by verbs|cause]] the first case include „að vera“ (to be) and „að heita“ (to be called).

Examples:

*'''Kötturinn''' minn borðaði kvöldmatinn minn. (My cat ate my dinner) – The cat is the main [[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence.
*'''Hann''' er ekki '''góður''' '''köttur'''. (He is not a good cat) – "He" is the main [[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence, "good cat" is in the first case because „að vera“ causes the first case.
