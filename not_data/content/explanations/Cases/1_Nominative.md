# Nominative case <small>– the first case</small>

There are four [[cases]] in Icelandic. The first case in the [[declension table]] is the '''nominative case''' (''nefnifall'', abbreviated as ''nf.'').<note>''Nefnifall'' means "naming case", and ''nominative'' is Latin meaning "related to naming".</note> It is the default case for a word. The main word of the sentence (the subject, the word that is doing something) is usually always in the nominative case.

The [[Helper word|helper words]] you use to force a word into the nominative case is „hér er“ ("here is").

Very few verbs [[Cases caused by verbs|cause]] the nominative case, but of those the important ones are „að vera“ (to be) and „að heita“ (to be called).

Examples:

*'''Kötturinn''' minn borðaði kvöldmatinn minn. (My cat ate my dinner) – The cat is the main [[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence.
*'''Hann''' er ekki '''góður''' '''köttur'''. (He is not a good cat) – "He" is the main [[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence, "good cat" is in the first case because „að vera“ causes the first case.
