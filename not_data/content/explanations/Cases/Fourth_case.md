There are four [[cases]] in Icelandic. The '''fourth case''' in the [[declension table]] is known as the "genitive case".<note>On Ylhýra we refer to it as the "fourth case" for simplicity's sake since you will always see these four cases listed in the same order in the [[declension table]].

In Icelandic the first case is called '''eignarfall''' and is abbreviated as '''ef.''' Eignarfall literally means "owning case". The English name "genitive" means "pertaining to origin" in Latin.</note> It shows that the word belongs to something.

The [[helper word]] you use to force a word into the fourth case is „til“ ("to").
