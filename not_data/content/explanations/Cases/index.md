# Cases (<i>föll</i>)

[[Nouns]], [[adjectives]], and [[pronouns]] all change their form depending on what's happening to them in a sentence. There are four such '''cases''' in Icelandic:

1. The first case is the '''[[nominative case]]''' (''nefnifall, nf.''). It indicates '''being'''. The main word of the sentence is usually always in this case.
2. The second case is the '''[[accusative case]]''' (''þolfall, þf.''). It indicates '''suffering'''.
3. The third case is the '''[[dative case]]''' (''þágufall, þgf.''). It indicates '''having'''. It shows that the word has something or is being given something.
4. The fourth case is the '''[[genitive case]]''' (''eignarfall, ef.''). It indicates '''belonging''', showing that the word belongs to something.

These cases are always shown in the same order, and you should follow this order when [[declension|studying words]]. (If you have studied languages such as German, Latin, or Russian, note that they use a different order for their cases).<note>The standard way of showing the four cases in German is ''[[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[accusative]]'' while in Icelandic the order is ''[[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]]''.</note>

Some words, like “lamb”, don’t change that much:

{{declension-singular|lamb|lamb|lamb'''i'''|lamb'''s'''}}

But other words, like “cat”, change a lot:

{{declension-singular|kött'''ur'''|kött|k'''e'''tt'''i'''|k'''a'''tt'''ar'''}}

The first case (the [[nominative]]) is the default case and is the one that is shown in dictionaries.

## Comparison to English
The Icelandic cases can be compared to the different forms that English [[pronouns]] have. In the sentence “'''''He''''' took '''''his''''' book with <b><i>him</i></b>”, the word “he” appears three times, but is different each time, indicating what function the word has in the sentence. "He" is analogous to the [[first case]] in Icelandic, "him" is analogous to both the [[Second case|second]] and the [[third case]], and "his" is analogous to the [[fourth case]].
