==Stress on words==
Words are always pronounced with the stress (the emphasis) on the first part (the first syllable) of the word:

*"maður" is pronounced '''''MAÐ'''ur''
*"tölvurnar" is pronounced '''''TÖLV'''urnar''
*"syngjandi" is pronounced '''''SYNG'''jandi''

Be aware that this also applies to words of a foreign origin:

*"Ameríka" is pronounced '''''AM'''eríka''
*"japanska" is pronounced '''''JAP'''anska''

In [[Compound words|compound words]], the sub-words can have stress, but the main emphasis is on the beginning of the word:

*"forsætisráðherra" is pronounced '''''FOR'''sætis'''RÁÐ'''herra''
*"vetrarskór" is pronounced '''''VET'''rar'''SKÓR'''''
*"vegavinnufyrirtæki" is pronounced '''''VEG'''avinnu'''FYR'''irtæki''
*"heimsótt" is pronounced '''''HEIM SÓTT'''''

==Stress in sentences==
There's no requirement that you ''have'' to place a stress on the start of every word (although that is the only place you can place a stress). In sentences, it is sufficient to keep the stress only on important words and on words you want to highlight. (See the article on [[intonation]] for examples.)

===Unstressed words don't have long sounds===
Have a look at this sentence:

*"'''''MAM'''ma og '''PAB'''bi ætla að koma á '''EFt'''ir''".

If we wanted to, we could have placed stress on the word "koma", but we don't have to. The O in "koma" is normally a [[Long sound|long sound]], but long sounds can only exist where there is stress. Therefore we pronounce a short O sound in that sentence.

All long sounds become short when a word is unstressed.

===Unstressed words don't have the [[Preaspiration|small breaths]]===
The word "[[ekki]]" is pronounced /eʰki/, with a small [[Preaspiration|breath of air]] being blown out right before the ''kk''. If the word is stressed, the small breath of air is absolutely necessary – without it people cannot understand you. However, if the word is unstressed there's no need for the breath. You can (and should) just pronounce it as /eki/.

*"'''''ÞAÐ''' er ekki '''RÉTT'''''", meaning "that's not true" is pronounced /<u>það er iggi rétt</u>/
*"''það er '''EKK'''i '''RÉTT'''''", meaning "that's '''not''' true" is pronounced /<u>það er eʰki rétt</u>/
