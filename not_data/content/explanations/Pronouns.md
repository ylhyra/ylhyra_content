==Possessive pronouns==

Possessive pronouns are the words we use to describe that something belongs to someone or something. Thus in English one might say

:Hey! That’s '''my''' book! Go buy your own!

:We walked to '''her''' car and quickly got in.

:'''Their''' baby was playing with '''his''' toys and drooled all over them.

In Icelandic, we may make a distinction between my/your and the other possessive pronouns. The words ''minn'' (my) and ''þinn'' (your) conjugate like other words we have learned.

<!-- LM I made these examples from scratch so they're probably wrong -->
:Ég keypti bók handa '''bróður mínum''' ''I bought a book for '''my brother'''.''

Here, both ''bróðir'' and ''minn'' are in dative, because they follow the preposition ''handa''.

:Við fórum kringum '''húsið þítt''' ''We went around '''your house'''.''

Here, both ''hús'' and ''þinn'' are in accusitive, because they follow the preposition ''kringum''.

Other possessive pronouns, like ''hennar'' (her), ''ykkar'' (your) and ''þess'' (its), do not change according to the case. In other words, you always use the same form:

:Ég keypti bók handa '''bróður hennar''' ''I bought a book for '''her brother'''.''

Here, ''bróðir'' is still in dative (because of the ''handa''), but ''hennar'' remains the same (in genitive, because it expresses possession).

:Við fórum kringum '''húsið okkar''' ''We went to '''our house'''.''

Again, ''hús'' is in accusitive (because of the ''kringum'') but ''okkar'' is still in genitive, because it expresses possession.

This difference may seem very unintuitive at first. It might help to realize that ''minn'' and ''þinn'' have an entire declension table:

The other possessive pronouns, however, are just the genitive case of their respective pronouns:

|Nf.
|hann
|þeir
|-
|Þf.
|hann
|þá
|-
|Þgf.
|honum
|þeim
|-
|Ef.
|hans
|þeirra
|}

==Sitt and Sín==

There is a last personal pronoun that only occurs in particular cases. Sometimes a verb carries with it the implication that the person who is ‘doing’ does that thing to themselves, as in

:I couldn’t '''bring myself''' to go to the lecture on Monday morning.

:Are you '''enjoying yourselves''' in the hot springs?

Icelandic has verbs that work just the same way:

:Hann '''rakar sig''' áður en að hann fer í leikhús. ''He '''shaves himself''' before going to the theatre''

:Barnið '''skemmtir sitt''' mjög mikið í sundlauginu! ''The child '''enjoyed itself''' much in the pool!''

For such verbs, the personal pronouns ''sinn''(m) ''sín''(f) and ''sitt''(n) are used. These are, like everything else, also declensed for case and number:

{| class="wikitable"
!
!
!Eintala

:Sigurður notar fartölvuna '''sína''' ''Sigurður is using '''his own''' laptop''

:Sigurður notar fartölvuna '''hans''' ''Sigurður is using '''his''' (i.e. someone else’s) laptop''

and between

:Katrín þvær dóttur '''sína''' ''Katrín washes '''her own''' daughter''

:Katrín þvær dóttur '''hennar''' ''Katrín washes '''her''' (i.e. someone else’s) daughter''
