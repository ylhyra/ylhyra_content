## I
"Ég" means "I".

The letter [[É]] is pronounced <Audio src="iD48.mp3" inline/>. It is not a single sound but two, being pronounced like "yeah" in English.

The letter G in the word "ég" is a [[Soft G|'''soft G''']] sound. The soft G sound is often so soft that it completely disappears, and that is the case for the word "ég". You do not pronounce the "g" in "ég" at all, you just pronounce it as {{pron|é}}.

## I am
"Ég er" means "I am". The letter '''[[R]]''' <Audio src="SpJM.mp3" inline/> is pronounced by tapping the roof of your mouth once quickly with the tongue, like the American pronunciation of ''au'''t'''umn'' or ''be'''tt'''er''.

Remember that "ég" is just pronounced {{pron|é}}.

## Good
Like all other [[adjectives]], the word "good" changes its form depending on the [[gender]] of the person or word it's describing. There are three grammatical genders in Icelandic: he ([[masculine]]), she ([[feminine]]), and it ([[neuter]]).

*Hann er '''góður'''. = He is good.
*Hún er '''góð'''. = She is good.
*Það er '''gott'''. = It is good.

The letter [[Ó]] pronounced <Audio src="UKe9.mp3" inline/>, like in the English "''g'''oa'''l''". Ó is pronounced as a sequence of two sounds: "[[o]][[ú]]". In both "góð" and "góður" it's a [[long sound]], and it's better to exaggerate the length of long sounds rather than making them too short.

If you're male, you use the [[masculine]] form and say:

*Ég er góður í íslensku. = I am good at Icelandic ("I am good in Icelandic"); I know Icelandic well.

If you're female, you use the [[feminine]] form and say:

*Ég er góð í íslensku.

Remember that "ég" is just pronounced {{pron|é}}. "Ég er góð" is therefore pronounced {{pron|é er goooúð}}.

In the last chapter, you saw the phrase "Hvað segirðu gott?". The word "good" doesn't refer to a particular person or a particular word, so by default we use the [[neuter]] form "gott" to refer to a vague "it/that".

Notice which form of the word "good" is used in the following conversation:

<Conversation>
you: Hvað segirðu '''gott'''?
me: Allt '''gott'''. En þú?
you: Allt '''gott'''.
you: Ert þú '''góður''' í íslensku.
me: Já. Ég er mjög '''góður''' í íslensku.
you: Það er '''gott'''.
you: Er mamma þín líka '''góð''' í íslensku?
me: Já, hún er líka mjög '''góð''' í íslensku.
</Conversation>

## You are

*Þú ert góður í íslensku. = You are good at Icelandic. ("You are good in Icelandic.")

Do note:

*'''[[Þ]]''' is pronounced like "'''''th'''ick''".
*'''[[Ú]]''' is pronounced like "''f'''oo'''d''".
*The '''[[R]]''' in "ert" is pronounced differently from the R in "er". The R in "ert" is a [[Breathy R|'''breathy R''']] <Audio src="iZyO.mp3" inline/>. It may sound more similar to an S than an R at first, but it is an R sound. To pronounce it, do the following: Start with the '''''r''''' sound in the American '''''r'''ed''. Keep your tongue in that position. Then blow air over the tip of your tongue.

Notice how the form of the word "is" changes:

*ég '''er''' = I am
*þú '''ert''' = you are
*hún '''er''' = she is

## Very
"Mjög" means "very". Like with the word "ég", the letter G in "mjög" is a [[soft G]] that isn't pronounced at all.

The letter '''[[Ö]]''' <Audio src=" 3AF6.mp3" inline/>is pronounced similarly to the English ''b'''i'''rd'' or ''n'''u'''rse'', but you do have to make your mouth circle-shaped and you have to pronounce it in the front of your mouth. In the word "mjög" it's a very long sound, and you should exaggerate its length. Since the G is silent, you can imagine it being written {{pron|mjööö}}.

Practice pronouncing the following by exaggerating the length of "mjög" and "góð":

*Ég er mjög góð í íslensku. {{pron|é er mjuööö goooúð í íslensku}}

you: Er þetta gott?
me: Já, þetta er mjög gott.
you: Ert þú góður í íslensku?
me: Já, ég er mjög góður í íslensku.
