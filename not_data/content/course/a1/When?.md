==When?==
"Hvenær" means "when?". Rembember that "[[hv]]" is always pronounced "kv". There is one additional exception that only applies to the word "hvenær" that is fairly annoying for students: The letter "[[æ]]" in the word isn't fully pronounced, instead it is pronounced as an "[[a]]". "Hven'''æ'''r" is pronounced {{pron|k{{h}}ven'''a'''r}}.

"Ísland" means "Iceland", but in the above text we used "Ísland'''i'''" and "Ísland'''s'''". The reason is that Icelandic words change their form depending on what is happening to them, like how the English word "he" changes to "him" depending on the word's purpose in the sentence. These forms are known as '''[[cases]]''' and there are four of them in Icelandic. You can [https://inflections.ylhyra.is/%C3%8Dsland/466527 click here] to see all the forms the word "Ísland" can have. You should not study the cases for now, you just need to be aware of the reason why the words change their form.

The [[prepositions]] "í" (in) and "á" (on) are used to say you're in a place. You are '''''on''''' Iceland and '''''on''''' Spain, but you're '''''in''''' America and '''''in''''' France (see the article [[Í vs. á|'''í vs. á''']] for a longer list). There is no rule behind which one you should use, the only thing that matters is whether native speaker feel like they're ''in'' or ''on'' something. Therefore, you as a language learner just need to remember each one individually.

==What did you just say?==

'''Ha?''' is equivalent to the English "Huh?" or "Hm?" but is used way more than in English. It means ''“What did you just say?”'', but it's not rude at all. You say "`ha?`" when:

*You didn’t hear what the other person said
*You just ''can’t believe'' what the other person said

The manner in which it is said is a bit harsh, and therefore many students feel that it sounds agressive or rude. That's not the case at all, "ha?" is a very normal word and is not rude at all. It is used both between friends and in professional settings.

Remember that you don't say "Could you repeat that?" or "Would you mind talking a bit slower?", you just say "Ha?".

*1|Ert þú á Íslandi?
*2|Ha?
*1|Ert þú á Íslandi?
*2|Ah. Já, ég er á Íslandi.
*1|Ég er líka á Íslandi! :)
*2|Ha?? Það er frábært.
