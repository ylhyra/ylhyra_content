# Desires

"Mig langar" means "I want / I yearn for" and by itself most often describes what you want to do. It is a slightly sentimental way of describing your desires and is related to the English phrase "I long for".

In the same way that the English word "she" turns into "her" depending on what's happening to it in the sentence, the word "ég" (*I*) turns into "mig" (*me*) depending on context. "Ég" is the [[nominative case]] (the first case)<note>The nominative case</note> and "mig" is the [[accusative case]] (the second case).<note>The accusative case</note>

The grammar of "mig langar" is fairly confusing – it's "''**me** wants''" instead of "''**I** want''". The reason behind it<note>The reason is that "að langa" is an [[impersonal verb]].</note> is not important right now.

The [[accusative case]] (second case) of "þú" (*you*) is "þig", so "you want" is "þig langar".
