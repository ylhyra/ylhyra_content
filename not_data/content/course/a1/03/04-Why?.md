## Why?
"Af hverju?" means "why?".<note>Word-by-word the translation is "Of what [reason]?" "Hverju" is the [[dative case]] (the third case) of "hvað" (*what*).</note> It has an extremely slurred pronounciation and is in most cases pronounced {{p|a{{h}}kkuru}}.

"Af því að" means "because".<note>Word-by-word the translation is "Of that [reason] that". "Því" is the [[dative case]] (the third case) of "það".</note> The letter V in "því" is usually not pronounced,<note>This almost never happens in other words.</note> and even the F and the Ð are quite soft in this phrase so they also disappear.<note>Ð always has a tendency to disappear; F disappears only because the Þ next to it overshadows it.</note> The pronunciation is therefor {{p|a þí a}}.
