==Asking for coffee==
"Að fá" means "to get". "Ég hef fengið" means "I have gotten". "Fá" and "fengið" are the same word, but "fengið" has a different form because it's in the [[past participle]] form, same as "gotten". In both Icelandic and English, the [[past participle]] appears when you say "I ''have'' gotten", but in Icelandic it also appears when you say "I ''can'' get" (if English followed the Icelandic pattern it would be "I ''can'' gotten").

==Here you go==
"Gjörðu svo vel" is a phrase you should only study as a phrase.<note>The reason is that "gjörðu" is a word form that no longer exists in modern Icelandic although this phrase survives, today we would say "gerðu". The phrase means "Do so well".</note> It's used to mean "here you go" (said when handing an item to somebody) and sometimes by store clerks to say "Next, please" ("Næsti, gjörðu svo vel").

The pronunciation of this phrase is quite [[Disappearing sounds|slurred]], it's pronounced {{pron|gjössovel}}.

==How good do you have to be to order in Icelandic?==
It may seem like a great opportunity to practice your Icelandic skills when at a restaurant, but that's not the case. Ordering food requires fluency and near-perfect listening skills.

To temper your expectations: You should not attempt to order in Icelandic until you've reached a [[B2]] level, which takes at least two years of study.

This can be quite disappointing to learners, but you do have to limit your expectations when it comes to real-life interactions with strangers. Very few people have experience in listening to people who are at an [[A1]]–[[A2]] level. Even those who are trying their best to be patient will eventually choose the path of least resistance and switch to English if it's unclear how well you've understood them. For waiters, this is a larger problem. Waiters are under a lot of pressure at work and are not going to be able to show you patience. If you hesitate for even a second or if your pronunciation isn't clear, people will to switch to English and will keep on responding to you in English even if you continue to speak Icelandic to them.

Don't worry too much about speaking to strangers for now. In time you will reach that [[B2]] level.
