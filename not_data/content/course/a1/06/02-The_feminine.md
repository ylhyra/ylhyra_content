The [[feminine]] form of the [[definite article]] is "hin". Lets take two examples:
- "Bók" is a feminine noun. We add "hin" to the end of it and we get "bók + {{g|h}}in". We don't care about the "h" and we're left with "bók'''in'''" ('''the''' book).
- "Kona" is also a feminine noun. To add a definite article to it, we create "kona + {{g|h}}in". We don't care about the "h" and so we're left with "kona + in". The vowel in the noun is much more important than the vowel in the definite article, so we're left with "kona + n". The result is "kona**n**" ('''the''' woman).
