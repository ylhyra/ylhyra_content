# My family members
When using "minn", you always have to use the [[definite article]]. There are two major exceptions to this rule, which are when talking about someone's:
1. Friend
2. Specific direct relatives using words such as a sister, brother, mother, father, son, daughter, grandma, grandpa, aunt, and uncle (but '''not''' words such as child, family, husband, wife, girlfriend, and boyfriend)

Instead of saying "vinur'''inn''' minn", you say "vinur minn".

* The definite article is also sometimes omitted in formal written speech and in certain old phrases, but you do not need to worry about that.
