# My family members
When using "minn", you always have to use the [[definite article]]. There are two major exceptions to this rule, which are when talking about someone's:
1. Friend
2. Specific direct relatives such as a sister, brother, mother, father, son, daughter, grandma, and grandpa<note>Words such as husband, wife, family, girlfriend, and boyfriend do not describe specific direct relatives, and therefore they ''do'' use the definite article</note>

Instead of saying "vinur'''inn''' minn", you say "vinur minn".
<notes>
* The definite article is also sometimes omitted in formal written speech and in certain old phrases, but you do not need to worry about that.
