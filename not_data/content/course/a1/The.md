In English, the word “**the**” is a seperate word (“**the** day”), while in Icelandic it is attached to the end of the word (“dagur**inn**”). It is known as the [definite article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite article).

The suffix for the “the” changes (sometimes drastically) depending on a word’s [gender](http://localhost:3000/gender), [case](http://localhost:3000/cases), and plurality.

Understanding how to create the various forms of the definite article is easier if you know a little bit about its origins. The definite article was orginally the (now barely used) pronoun “hinn” (meaning “that thing over there”), and “the day” would have been “dagur hinn”. Remove the “h” and you’re left with “dagur**inn**” (“the day”).

“Hinn” is the form used for the [first case](http://localhost:3000/first-case) of [masculine](http://localhost:3000/gender) singular nouns. Taking two more examples:

- Köttur is a masculine noun. To add a definite article to it, you create “köttur + hinn”. You don’t care about the “h” and you’re left with “köttur**inn**” (the cat).
- Hamborgari is also a masculine noun. To add a definite article to it, you create “hamborgari + hinn”. You don’t care about the “h” and you’re left with “hamborgari + inn”. Here we have a little bit of a problem as now we have two vowels in competition, and we can’t leave them both. The vowel in the noun is much more important than the vowel in the definite article, so we’re left with “hamborgari + nn”. The result is “hamborgari**nn**” (the hamburger).
