In English, the word "**the**" is a seperate word ("**the** day"), while in Icelandic it is attached to the end of the word ("dagur**inn**"). It is known as the [[w:definite article|definite article]].

The suffix for the "the" changes depending on a word's [[gender]], [[case]], and plurality.

Understanding how to create the various forms of the definite article is easier if you think of it as it's own seperate [[pronoun]], which it (more or less) originally was. The definite article behaves the same as the very related (but rarely used) pronoun "hinn" (now meaning "the"). "The day" can be constructed as "dagur (h)inn",<!--<note>This is a simplification and is not entirely true, however it is sufficient for you to be able to construct the definite article. Those interested can see [https://doi.org/10.2478/v10122-009-0005-y
 Skrzypek (2010)] for further discussion about this etymology.</note>--> now remove the "h" and you're left with "dagur**inn**" (**the** day).

"Hinn" is the form used for the [[first case]] of [[masculine]] [[singular]] [[nouns]]. Taking two more examples:

- Köttur is a masculine noun. To add a definite article to it, you create "köttur + {{g|h}}inn". You don't care about the "h" and you're left with "köttur**inn**" (**the** cat).
- Hamborgari is also a masculine noun. To add a definite article to it, you create "hamborgari + {{g|h}}inn". You don't care about the "h" and you're left with "hamborgari + inn". Here we have a little bit of a problem as now we have two vowels in competition, and we can't leave them both. The vowel in the noun is much more important than the vowel in the definite article, so we're left with "hamborgari + nn". The result is "hamborgari**nn**" (**the** hamburger).
