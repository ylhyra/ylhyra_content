# In an hour

Discussing durations of time such as "in a week" and "for a week" is something that greatly confuses students since the [[prepositions]] used don't match up with the ones used in English. "Í eina viku" does not mean "in one week", it means "for one week".

{{phrase|í einn tíma|for one hour}}
{{phrase|eftir einn tíma|in one hour}}

Both of these phrases use the [[second case]]. 

Be aware that the "einn" is pronounced {{p|eídn}} and that the final "n" is not pronounced with the voice, instead you just place your tongue into the position of an "n" without making a sound. This {{p|dn}} sound only shows up when "nn" comes after an [[í]] or an [[ú]] sound (remember that [[ei]] is pronounced {{p|eí}}); the tongue is so close to the roof of the mouth in those sounds that it's easier to make a {{p|dn}} sound than an "n" sound.

The [[numbers]] from one to four all change their form depending on [[case]] and [[gender]]. The first two cases for the [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] are:

* hér er **einn** tími, um **einn** tíma
* hér er **ein** vika, um **eina** viku

The "ei" in "einn" is pronounced [[short|quickly]] because it is followed by two or more [[consonants]]. The "ei" in "ein" is a [[long sound]] because it is followed by one or fewer consonants.
