==Word merging==
If the word "þú" (you) appears [[Word order|after a verb]], such as in a [[question]], the "þú" gets attached to the verb, they merge together to form one word. If this were the case in English, "Are you?" would become "Areyou?". This only happens when the word form is "þú" and not for its other [[cases]] such as "þér".

"Þú" becomes simplified when this happens, and turns into a "-ðu" or "-u". If the verb itself already ends in a "t" or "ð", you just add a "-u", but if it ends in an "r" you add a "-ðu".

Although we add "-ðu" to verbs that end in "r", the "[[ð]]" is not pronounced. "Borðarðu" is just pronounced /borðaru/ and "segirðu" is just pronounced /segiru/. For that reason you will sometimes see people, especially younger speakers, write "segiru" instead of "segirðu". Do however note that the "ð" in "býrðu" is pronounced, because the verb itself ends in an "ð".
