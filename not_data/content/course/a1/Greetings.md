==Greetings==

===Hæ===

"Hæ" (hi) is a common, casual greeting.<!-- https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1706 --> Saying it twice ("hæ hæ") is also quite popular, it means the same thing but shows that you are cheerful.

===Halló===

"Halló" (hello) is used in the same situations as the English "hello", including when answering the telephone. The double L is pronounced like a normal L since it's borrowed from a foreign language.<note>It's a loan word from [[w:Danish language|Danish]].<ref>[https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=78021 Vísindavefurinn]</ref></note>

===Góðan daginn===
"Góðan daginn" means "Good day to you". You use this greeting from morning until 6 PM (or 18:00), after that it's evening and you have to switch to "Good evening to you". You use this greeting when:

*you first meet your family member, friend, or coworker early in the morning
*when you meet a stranger on the street (from morning until 6 PM)
*when greeting or addressing employees when you're a client (such as at the store, the café, the bank), including when calling a company on the phone

"Góðan" is the word "[https://inflections.ylhyra.is/g%C3%B3%C3%B0ur góður]", just in a different [[case]]. At this point in time you should not think about why this particular phrase uses a different word form,<note>The reason why this phrase uses unexpected grammatical forms ("góður" uses the [[second case]] and "dagur" has a [[definite article]]) is that the phrase is short for "I hope that you have the day good".</note> you should just memorize it as a phrase.

Notes on pronunciation:

*The [[Ð]] in "góðan" is so soft you can just skip it.
*The G in "daginn" makes the sound of [[J]].
*The phrase is pronounced /góan dayin/.

===Sæll===

"<translate>Sæll</translate>" is one of the most common ways to greet someone.<note>The word itself means "happy" or "content", the implied meaning is "I wish you happiness / good fortune".</note> Although it is a relatively formal greeting, it's used both between good friends and in a professional setting. You should use it when meeting your friend, when writing an email, and when addressing the prime minister. This greeting only works if you're in a situation where you already know something about the other person, if you don't know anything about them (such as when greeting a customer, or when writing an email to an organization) you should use "Góðan daginn".

"Sæll" is an [[adjective]], and therefore it changes its form depending on who it's describing. If you're greeting a man you say "Sæll" and if you're greeting a woman you say "Sæl". There's yet another form you need to use when addressing a group of people, but that's a topic for another time.

Notes on pronunciation:

*"Sæll" is pronounced quickly (the æ is [[short]] because it's followed by two [[consonant]] letters). The double L is a [[clicky double L]], meaning that you first pronounce a [[D]] sound and then a [[breathy L]] sound.
*The æ in "sæl" is [[Long vowel|long]] (it's only followed by one consonant). Althought the L in "sæl" is a normal L, several sounds [[Voiceless at the end of sentences|lose their voice at the ends of sentences]], so "Sæl!" is pronounced with a [[breathy L]].

===When to use which greeting===
To summarize the above:

*If you're seeing a good friend, use "Hæ" or "Sæll".
*If you're seeing a good friend early in the morning, use "Góðan daginn".
*If you're writing an email to someone you know something about, use "Sæll".
*If you're writing an email to someone you know nothing about, use "Góðan daginn".
*If you're speaking to a waiter at the coffee shop, use "Góðan daginn".
*If you see a random person on the street, use "Góðan daginn".
*If you see someone you personally know on the street, use "Hæ" or "Sæll".
*If you're answering the phone, use "Halló".
