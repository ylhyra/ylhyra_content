# Ég veit

"Ég veit" means "I know", but it refers only to knowing facts. It is important to remember not to use this word when saying that you know a person or that you know a language.

The way to say "''I don't know''" is:

{{phrase|Ég veit '''það''' ekki.|I don't know.}}

The literal meaning is "I don't know '''that'''". Be careful not to forget the word "það" in "Ég veit það ekki".

A note regarding the pronunciation of "Ég veit það ekki":

* The letter [[é]] is pronounced "je".
* The [[soft G|g]] in "ég" is [[disappearing sounds|not pronounced]]. "Ég" is just pronounced "é".
* The letter cluster [[ei]] is always pronounced "e[[í]]". It's good to overexaggerate your [[í]] sound in "veit".
* The "ei" in "veit" is a very [[long sound]]. It's better to overexaggerate the length of long sounds.
* The [[ð]] in "það" [[disappearing sounds|disappears]].
* Before a double [[k]], you have to [[exhalation|breathe out a little bit]]. "Ekki" is pronounced {{pron|e{{h}}gi}}.

<!-- *Listen to the 2018 pop song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrFXCSsEy_M '''Veist af mér'''] by Huginn (lyrics [https://genius.com/Huginn-veist-af-mer-lyrics here]). Focus on the phrases "''Þú veist'' af mér" (literally "You know of me", meaning "You know where to find me if you need me") and "Því ''ég veit''" ("Because I know").-->
