# Introduction to cases

[[Noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, and [[pronoun]]s change their form depending on what's happening to them in a sentence. There are four such **[[cases]]** in Icelandic. In this chapter we'll have a look at the first two cases of one common pattern – the "mamma" pattern.

The **[[first case]]**<note>Known as the *nominative case* / *nefnifall*.</note> is used when the word is the main word in the sentence<note>It's the *subject* of the sentence – the word that is doing something.</note> or when we're describing something as *being*.

The **[[second case]]**<note>Known as the *accusative case* / *þolfall*.</note> indicates that the word is having something done to it. As a general rule, you should use this case if there's a verb that describes what's happening to it. A major exception is that "to be" causes the first case.

Comparing the above to English: In the sentence "*she* took *her*", both "she" and "her" are the same word but have different forms to indicate what is happening to it. "She" is the subject of the sentence and would therefore use the Icelandic first case, while "her" is the object of the sentence and would use the Icelandic second case in this context.

This website uses the terms *first*, *second* and so on for simplicity's sake since the four cases are always shown in the same order. All other resources use the actual grammatical terms of the cases.

## The "mamma" pattern

There are about {{number of declension patterns}} basic [[List of noun declension patterns|declension patterns]] for nouns, out of which five patterns are the most important.

When studying the cases you always have to use [[helper words]] to force the word into the correct case. "Hér er" (meaning *here is*) forces a word into the first case, and "um" (meaning *about*) forces a word into the second case.

The first two cases of "kona" (a woman) are:<note>[Click here](https://inflections.ylhyra.is/kona/393384) to see the full table for "kona".</note>

* hér er kon**a**, um kon**u**

All [[feminine]] nouns that end in "-a" (such as "mamma")<note>However, mamma includes a [[sound change]]: hér er mamma, um m**ö**mmu.</note> follow this pattern. Other examples are:

* hér er píts**a**, um píts**u**
* hér er íslensk**a**, um íslensk**u**

Examples of usage:

* Pítsa er góð. (*Pizza is good*. ) – We use the first case since it's the main word of the sentence.
* Ég borða pítsu. (*I eat pizza.*) – The verb "að borða" describes what is happening to the pizza. The pizza is the object of the sentence.
* Íslenska er falleg. (*Icelandic is beautiful.*) – First case since it's the main word.
* Ég kann íslensku. (*I know Icelandic.*) – It's the object of the sentence and the verb "að kunna" applies to it.
* Ég á konu. (*I have a wife.*) – Kona is the object of the sentence and the verb "að eiga" applies to it.
