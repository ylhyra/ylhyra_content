# Future

To discuss [[future]] events, you just use the normal [[present]] tense. It will be obvious from context that you're talking about the future. Instead of saying "I **will** not come", you just say "I come not".

"Að koma" means "to come" and "ég kem" means "I come". The [[K]] in *koma* is a normal K while the K in *kem* is a [[K in the roof of the mouth]] <Audio src="c__j.mp3" inline/>. The sound is pronounced by having the most backwards part of your tongue touch the roof of your mouth, and is close to the sound in the English word '''''c'''ute''. This sound always appears if an E follows a K.
