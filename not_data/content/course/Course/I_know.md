==I don't know==
"Ég veit" means "I know" (referring to knowledge and not skills such as guitar and languages).

The way to say "''I don't know''" is "Ég veit '''það''' ekki" (meaning "I do not know '''that'''"). Be careful not to forget the word "það" in "Ég veit það ekki".

The word changes depending on person like so:

*ég veit = I know
*þú vei'''s'''t = you know
*hann veit = he knows

{{conversation|
{{1|Hvað ætlar þú að gera í dag?}}
{{2|Ég veit það ekki}}
{{1|Veist þú hvenær mamma þín kemur?}}
{{2|Nei, ég veit ekki hvenær hún kemur.}}
{{1|Veist þú hvar hún er?}}
{{2|Nei, ég veit það ekki}}
}}The word "[[að]]" has two main meanings, it can mean "to" as in "to eat", but it can also join two sentences together as in "You know ''that'' I am eating":

*Þú veist ''að'' ég er að borða. = You know ''that'' I am eating.
*Ég veit ''að'' mamma þín er mjög góð í íslensku. = I know ''that'' your mother is very good at Icelandic.

==This and that==
There are two words that you can use to point to things: "þetta" (''this'') and "það" (''that'').<ref>This is a simplification.</ref><!-- They have a very similar meaning, but "þetta" points to things with more force (making it ideal for pointing to objects or for when you're being specific) while "það" points to things with less precision (making it better for pointing out ideas, situations or events). -->

*1|Hvað er '''þetta'''?
*2|Hm, '''það''' er góð spurning. Ég veit ekki hvað '''þetta''' er.

As you remember, there are three [[Gender|grammatical genders]] in Icelandic: he ([[masculine]]), she ([[feminine]]), and it ([[neuter]]). All [[nouns]] have a gender, and other words change their form to adapt to the gender of the word they apply to. The gender of words is just a grammatical quirk and does not affect how people perceive the objects themselves – although the word for ''hamburger'' is masculine, the hamburger itself is not perceived as a manly object. You cannot know what gender a word is just by looking at it, instead it's something you memorize slowly by seeing how the other words in the sentence adapt to it.

"[https://inflections.ylhyra.is/%C3%BEetta/478813 Þetta]" is only the form used for neuter (''it'') words. "Þetta" changes its form depending on the gender of the word it applies to, and becomes "þessi" for [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] words.

*þetta kaffi = this coffee. — ''Kaffi'' is a [[neuter]] word.
*þessi hamborgari = this hamburger. — ''Hamborgari'' is a [[masculine]] word.

When you have not yet specified a word, or when the word stands by itself like when you say "this thing right here", you use the neuter form by default:

*Þetta er gott kaffi. = This thing here is some good coffee.
*Þetta er góður hamborgari. = This thing here is a good hamburger. — We use the neuter form by default since we're saying "this thing" and not "this hamburger".

==Excercise==
Translate the following:

*This is great. = Þetta er frábært.
*That is great. = Það er frábært.
*What are you doing? = Hvað ert þú að gera?
*You don't know what you're doing. = Þú veist ekki hvað þú ert að gera.
*I don't know. = Ég veit það ekki.
*My mother doesn't know that I am eating a hamburger. = Mamma mín veit ekki að ég er að borða hamborgara.
*I don't know what your mother is doing. = Ég veit ekki hvað mamma þín er að gera.
*Do you know where I am? = Veist þú hvar ég er?
*My mother doesn't know. = Mamma mín veit það ekki.
*My mother doesn't know what this is. = Mamma mín veit ekki hvað þetta er.

==Vocabulary==

*ég veit = I know
*þú veist = you know
*hann veit = he knows
*ég veit það ekki = I don't know
*hvar = where?
*þetta kaffi = this coffee
*þessi hamborgari = this hamburger

==Recommendations==

*Listen to the 2018 pop song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrFXCSsEy_M '''Veist af mér'''] by Huginn (lyrics [https://genius.com/Huginn-veist-af-mer-lyrics here]). Focus on the phrases "''Þú veist'' af mér" (literally "You know of me", meaning "You know where to find me if you need me") and "Því ''ég veit''" ("Because I know").
