There are two ways to say “I want” in Icelandic:

*`mig langar` = _I want, I desire_. This is the same variation as you might be familiar with from English, _“I '''long for''' the carefree days of my youth.”_ meaning having a strong desire for something, but in Icelandic the meaning is not as strong and generally just means “I want”.
*`ég vil` = _I want_. This is a bit more direct than _mig langar_. You can remember it from the English _“It is my '''will'''”_.
