{{start|Chapter 1/Hello}}

`Halló` and `hæ` are the most common ways to casually greet someone. They sound almost exactly like their English counterparts.

See how many other words you sort of recognize in this interaction between a mother and her child:

{{conversation|
{{them|Halló!}}
{{them|Hvernig var skólinn?}}
{{me|Fínn.}}
{{them|Gott að heyra. Ert þú þyrstur? Vilt þú kók?}}
{{me|Nei takk. Ég er ekki þyrstur.}}
}}

If you squint a little, you should be able to recognize ''hello, hi, mom, school, fine, hear, thirsty'', and ''Coke''.
