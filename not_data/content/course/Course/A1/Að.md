{{start|Text:Að/Intro}}
{{is|[[Að]]}} is used a lot in Icelandic. It can have several different uses, but most often it means '''to''' as in "'''to''' sing" ({{is|'''að''' syngja}}). Another common use of "að" is to connect sentence together: {{is|Bjarni segir '''að''' mamma komi á eftir}}, but that is a more advanced topic.

Like in English, when using the basic form of the verb (called the [[infinitive]] {{nh}} form), we usually include the "að":

*{{is|Hann lærir '''að''' lesa í skólanum.}} = He learns '''to''' read in school.
*{{is|Ég þarf '''að''' pissa.}} = I need '''to''' pee.
*{{is|Ég nenni ekki '''að''' tala við hann.}} = I'm not in the mood '''to''' talk to him.

But we also use it when English would use an '''-ing''' ending:{{efn|The -ing verb form in English is known as "gerund" or "present participle".}}

*{{is|Ég er '''að''' syngja.}} = I am singing.
*{{is|Ég kem ekki á morgun, ég er '''að''' vinna.}} = I won't come tomorrow, I am working.
*{{is|Hvað ert þú '''að''' gera?!}} = What are you doing?!
