The Icelandic service industry doesn't really put an emphasis on superfluous politeness like you may know from America. However, you might sometimes hear some variation of "Have a nice day!" here. This practice is new, imported by business owners who have studied abroad, and strikes many Icelanders as a very unnatural way of ending a conversation. But most are just happy that someone is wishing them a good day.
