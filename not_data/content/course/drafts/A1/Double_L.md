title: Course/A1/Double L
---

When two {{code|L}}'s are in a row, the pronunciation can seem a bit strange. {{code|LL}} is pronounced like ['''tl''']:

*`full`, `lítill`, `allir`, `jökull`, `engill`, `krókódíll`

Some words don't have this click sound, those words tend to be either foreign or cute:

* `halló`, `milljón`, `brilljant`, `bolla`, `Solla`, `Halli`
