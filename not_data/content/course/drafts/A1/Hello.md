`Halló` and `hæ` are the most common ways to casually greet someone. They sound almost exactly like their English counterparts.

See how many other words you sort of recognize in this interaction between a mother and her child:

<Conversation>
you: Halló!
you: Hvernig var skólinn?
me: Fínn.
you: Gott að heyra. Ert þú þyrstur? Vilt þú kók?
me: Nei takk. Ég er ekki þyrstur.
</Conversation>

If you squint a little, you should be able to recognize ''hello, hi, mom, school, fine, hear, thirsty'', and ''Coke''.
