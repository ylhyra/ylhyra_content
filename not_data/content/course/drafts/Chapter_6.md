# Verbs in Icelandic

There are many ways of saying how you are doing something. For example: ''I '''am''' cycling'', ''yesterday I '''went''' grocery shopping'', ''tomorrow I '''will watch''' a movie'', ''the world '''would have been''' a better place without ants'', and so on.

These ways of telling someone what you are doing, have been doing, or will do, are slightly different in Icelandic, although there are many similarities with English. One example is what is called the ''present continuous'', when you are saying that you are right in the middle of something.

Compare:

{| class="wikitable"
!English
!Icelandic
|-
|I am cycling
|Ég er að hjóla
|-
|You are reading
|Þú ert að lesa
|-
|We are working
|Við erum að vinna
|}

Each time, we use the construction '''að …'''. The '''að''' marks that we are taking the ‘whole verb’ here (or the ''infinitive'', if you like fancy words). The word <code>að</code> has many other functions, but we need not concern ourselves with those just yet.

This form of verbs is used whenever you want to express that you are busy with something, or doing something right now. That could also be more abstract, like in ''ég er að læra íslensku'': I am learning Icelandic. <!-- LM make this into a little dialogue? would make the context clearer -->

You might not be leafing through a book about Icelandic grammar at the moment of uttering that sentence. It merely means that you are in the business of learning Icelandic. Another example might be:

<!-- LM I need to find a nicer form to represent dialogues but I don't want to bother right now. Also this dialogue is horribly stifled. I want to show that there are 2 ways to translate the infinitive case to English; please insert a better example if possible. -->

> A: Hvað ertu að gera? '''What are you doing?'''

> B: Ég er að lesa bók. '''I am reading a book.'''

> A: Mér finnst það skemmtilegt að lesa bækur '''I find it much fun to read books'''

> B: Ég er sammála! '''I agree!'''

Notice that '''að lesa''' is translated in the second sentence as '''reading''', while in the third sentence it is translated as '''to read'''. The að-construction can be translated as both. The context will make it clear which interpretation is needed. But notice, too, that they are sometimes exchangeable: in sentence 3 we might as well have said 'I find reading books much fun'.

##An introduction to verbs

The word you'll probably use the most is the verb "to be".
að vera (to be)
ég er (I am)
þú ert (you are)
ég var (I was)
þú varst (you were)
ég held að ég sé (I think that I am)
As you notice, að vera can change a lot, just like the English version.
Look closely at the table. You'll need to recognize að vera very well.

``
Ég er 14 ára. Ég er ekki í vinnu, en ég er í skóla. Það er gaman í skólanum, vinir mínir eru skemmtilegir. Í gær vorum við lengi í skólanum, allir mánudagarnir mínir eru langir. Ég var frekar þreyttur. Það er samt allt í lagi, kennarinn minn segir að ég sé góður nemandi.

I am 14 years old. I am not at work (working?), but I am in school. It is fun in school, my friends are great fun. Yesterday we were at school a long time, all my mondays are long. I was rather tired. It is still okay, my teacher said that I am a good student.
``

As you'll notice, the word að ("to") pops up a lot in Icelandic. It is used to make the base version of a verb (infinitive). You recognize this from English:
Ég þarf að fara = I need to go
Hann ætlar að borða þetta = He is going to eat that
But the base version of verbs is use more broadly than in English:
Ég er að borða = I am eating
Hann er að keyra = He is driving
Ég fíla ekki að hlaupa = I don't like running
As you can see, að hlaupa is both used for to run and running.
