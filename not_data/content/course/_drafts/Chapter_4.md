==At the supermarket==
Since you will go to the store multiple times a week, you'll get very comfortable at repeating this formulaic interaction:

{{conversation|
{{them|Góðann daginn!}}
{{me|Góðan dag 😊}}
{{them|Viltu '''poka'''?}}
{{me|Já takk.}}
{{them|Þetta eru 2.000 krónur.}}
{{them|Viltu '''kvittun'''?}}
{{me|Nei takk.}}
}}

Practice this conversation a few times. It's all right if you don't know the numbers, the final amount will be shown on the cashier's computer display.

There are two common ways of asking if you want the receipt:

*`Viltu kvittun?` = Do you want a receipt?
*`Viltu afritið?` = Do you want the copy?

==Soft "G" sound==

Several words have a soft "G" sound that's sort of a mix between "G" and "Y". You create it by constricting air flow at the back of the tongue.

* '''{{listen|sunnudagur}}''', '''{{listen|ég}}''', '''{{listen|og}}''', '''{{listen|auga}}'''

When spoken quickly, this sound is sometimes very soft, or even completely hidden:

* '''{{listen|sunnudagur}}''', '''{{listen|ég}}''', '''{{listen|og}}''', '''{{listen|auga}}'''

==Superflous politeness==
The Icelandic service industry doesn't really put an emphasis on superfluous politeness like you may know from America. However, you might sometimes hear some variation of "Have a nice day!" here. This practice is new, imported by business owners who have studied abroad, and strikes many Icelanders as a very unnatural way of ending a conversation. But most are just happy that someone is wishing them a good day.

==Ordering food==

You order food by saying "Can I get coffee?"

* `Get ég fengið kaffi?`
* `Get ég fengið bjór?`
* `Get ég fengið fisk?`

==Language – I want==

There are two ways to say “I want” in Icelandic:

*`mig langar` = _I want, I desire_. This is the same variation as you might be familiar with from English, _“I '''long for''' the carefree days of my youth.”_ meaning having a strong desire for something, but in Icelandic the meaning is not as strong and generally just means “I want”.
*`ég vil` = _I want_. This is a bit more direct than _mig langar_. You can remember it from the English _“It is my '''will'''”_.

==What opinions do you hold?==
