Since you will go to the store multiple times a week, you'll get very comfortable at repeating this formulaic interaction:

<Conversation>
you: G칩칧ann daginn!
me: G칩칧an dag 游땕
you: Viltu '''poka'''?
me: J치 takk.
you: 룐tta eru 2.000 kr칩nur.
you: Viltu '''kvittun'''?
me: Nei takk.
</Conversation>

Practice this conversation a few times. It's all right if you don't know the numbers, the final amount will be shown on the cashier's computer display.

There are two common ways of asking if you want the receipt:

*`Viltu kvittun?` = Do you want a receipt?
*`Viltu afriti칧?` = Do you want the copy?
