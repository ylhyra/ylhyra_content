Since you will go to the store multiple times a week, you'll get very comfortable at repeating this formulaic interaction:

<Conversation>
you: Góðann daginn!
me: Góðan dag 😊
you: Viltu '''poka'''?
me: Já takk.
you: Þetta eru 2.000 krónur.
you: Viltu '''kvittun'''?
me: Nei takk.
</Conversation>

Practice this conversation a few times. It's all right if you don't know the numbers, the final amount will be shown on the cashier's computer display.

There are two common ways of asking if you want the receipt:

*`Viltu kvittun?` = Do you want a receipt?
*`Viltu afritið?` = Do you want the copy?
