Icelandic words have a lot of tiny h-sounds in places that may not be obvious at first.

Let's take the word '''`takk`''' ("thanks") as an example. You need to let out a [[aspirations|tiny breath of air]] both after the "t" and before the "kk" so the word sounds like "t<span class="blue">(h)</span>a<span class="blue">(h)</span>kk".

* '''{{listen|takk}}'''

If you forget to add these breaths to pronunciations, Icelanders will have a very hard time understanding you.

Now, learn these phrases by heart:

* '''`Takk`''' = Thanks.
* '''`JÃ¡ takk`''' = Yes please.
* '''`Nei takk`''' = No thanks.
