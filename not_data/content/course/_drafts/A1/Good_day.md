Aside from `takk`, the other phrase you'll use every day is '''`[[Góðan daginn]]!`''' (“Good day!”). `Góðan daginn` is used from the early morning until 6PM (that's when the day turns into an evening).

Here are two popular ways to memorize the phrase `góðan daginn`:

*What do you do when you're hungry? You '''"go and dine"'''.
*'''Go! I'm dying!'''

You can also just skip the `góðan` part and just say `daginn`:

<Conversation>
you: Góðan daginn!
me: Daginn!
</Conversation>

Both phrases mean the same thing: "I wish you a good day".

Notice how extremely soft the letter [[ð]] is pronounced in the word `góðan`. The tongue doesn't even touch the teeth, and the sound has almost completely disappeared.

The letter [[g]] in the word `daginn` is pronounced like the Icelandic '''''j''''' or the English '''''y'''es''. This always happens to the letter g when it is between a [[vowel]] and the letter [[i]].
