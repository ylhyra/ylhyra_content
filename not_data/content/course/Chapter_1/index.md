In this chapter you'll see a few short texts that you should be able to understand by reading slowly and by clicking on the words to see their translations. Listen to the audio recordings a few times to get a feel for the pronunciation.
==A few new letters==
Many [[Alphabet|Icelandic letters]] have diacritics, but these three letters are especially unfamiliar:

The letter '''[[ð|Ð]]'''[[ð|/'''ð''']] is a ''d'' with a stroke. You can think of it as a very soft ''d'' or a soft ''th''. It can either sound like the English ''bro'''th'''er'', but it can also sound like the English ''bro'''th'''''. Sometimes this letter is so soft that it disappears.<blockquote>`bróðir, veður, glaður, garður, brauð`</blockquote>The letter '''[[þ|Þ]]'''[[þ|/'''þ''']] is completely new, and is unrelated to the letter ''P''. It usually has a strong ''th'' sound like the English '''''th'''ick'', but it can sometimes be soft like the ''ð'' letter above and sound like the English ''bro'''th'''er''. <blockquote>`þúsund, þykk`</blockquote>

==Are==
Notice how many Icelandic words are similar to the English ones. In particular, note how similar '''`[[Að vera|er]]`''' is to the English "'''are'''".

* Obama er frá Ameríku.
* Pútín er frá Rússlandi.
* Kaffi er heitt.
* Bjór er kaldur.
* Gras er grænt.
* Systir mín er lítil.
