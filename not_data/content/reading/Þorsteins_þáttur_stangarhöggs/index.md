'''''Þorsteins þáttur stangarhöggs''''' is an Icelandic [[w:þáttr|þáttur]] which tells the tale of a conflict between the houses of Þórarinn and Bjarni Brodd-Helgason at Hof, Iceland. The tale is thought to have originated in the mid-13th century, however its earliest known record is on vellum fragments dated to the 15th century. The vast majority of the modern translation comes from 17th century paper fragments. 

The þáttur is often examined as it is considered to have strong artistic merit, exemplify saga characteristics, and to be of an appropriate length to examine in its entirety.
