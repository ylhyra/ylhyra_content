[[w:Bubbi|Bubbi]] is an Icelandic rock musician who has been extremely popular since the 1980s. He is particularly well known for the song ''[https://open.spotify.com/track/482yyPr50nyGL29zctDNLE?si=9Xi7FTtsRk-Rx_kPtcCyKg Stál og hnífur]'' ("Steel and knife"), children learn the song in school and people sing it around the campfire.

The joke in this video is that a Mexican version of Bubbi jumps out and sings in a very strong Mexican accent.
