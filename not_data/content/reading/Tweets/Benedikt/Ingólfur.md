|text=„Við minnumst Ingólfs Arnarsonar í veislum<br>
en óskum þess að skipið hans það hefði sokkið“<ref>According to tradition Ingólfur Arnarson was first permanent settler of Iceland who founded Reykjavík in the year 874. <br/>
This tweet is a quote to a song by singer-songwriter [[w:Megas|Megas]] (the Icelandic version of Bob Dylan), the song is called ''Um óþarflega fundvísi Ingólfs Arnarsonar''. The quote refers to how even though Icelanders celebrate Ingólfur's feats, they still wish that his ship had sunk and so the country would not have become populated, because the weather and nature in Iceland is so hostile.</ref>
