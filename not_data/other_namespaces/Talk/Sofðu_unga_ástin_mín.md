Sleep, my young love.
Outside, the rain is weeping.
Mother will hold on to your precious toys,
an old bone from a lamb's leg and a box of toys. <!-- Völuskrín voru notuð til að geyma sauðarvölur, sem er smábein í hækli á sauðkind. Börn léku sér með sauðarvölur. -->
Let's not stay awake in the dark nights. 

The darkness knows many things.
My thoughts are heavy.
Often I have watched the dark sand
scorch <!-- destroy --> green fiields.
In the glacier the cracks in the ice, deep as death, cry out.

Sleep for long, sleep tight.
It's best to wake up late. 
These troubles will soon teach you,
as day turns to night,
that people love, lose, cry, and mourn.


Sleep, my young love.
Outside, the rain is weeping.
Mother will hold on to your precious toys,
an old bone from a lamb's leg and a pebble-shrine.
Let's not cry in the dark nights.
Sleep for long, sleep tight.
It's best to wake up late.
Because people love,
lose, cry and miss.
