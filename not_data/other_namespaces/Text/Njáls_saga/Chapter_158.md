`NB this is Kafli 159 in the Modern Icelandic version. Italics is original in English, bold original in Modern Icelandic, upright is my translation. Source http://sagadb.org/brennu-njals_saga.is. Haven't decided yet what I want to do with the names, whether to Anglicise them or leave them as is.`

**Nú er segja frá Kára að um sumarið eftir fór hann til skips síns og sigldi suður um sæ og hóf upp göngu sína í Norðmandí og gekk suður og þá lausn og fór aftur hina vestri leið og tók skip sitt í Norðmandí og sigldi norður um sjá til Dofra á Englandi. Þaðan sigldi hann vestur um Bretland og svo norður með Bretlandi og norður um Skotlandsfjörðu og létti eigi fyrr en hann kom norður í Þrasvík á Katanesi til Skeggja bónda. Fékk hann þá þeim Kolbeini og Dagviði byrðinginn. Sigldi Kolbeinn þessu skipi til Noregs en Dagviður var eftir í Friðarey. Kári var þenna vetur á Katanesi. Á þessum vetri andaðist húsfreyja hans á Íslandi.**

*Now it is to be told of Kari that the summer after he went down to his ship and sailed south across the sea, and began his pilgrimage in Normandy, and so went south and got absolution and fared back by the western way, and took his ship again in Normandy, and sailed in her north across the sea to Dover in England. Thence he sailed west, round Wales, and so north, through Scotland's Firths, and did not stay his course till he came to Thraswick in Caithness, to master Skeggi's house. There he gave over the ship of burden to Kolbein and David, and Kolbein sailed in that ship to Norway, but David stayed behind in the Fair Isle.
Kari was that winter in Caithness. In this winter his housewife died out in Iceland.*

The summer after Kari went to his ship and sailed south across the ocean, he began his pilgrimage in Normandy. He went (further) south and got (obtained) absolution and he sailed back via the west. He again boarded in Normandy and sailed north across the sea to Dover in England. From there he sailed west, around Wales, and north through Scotland’s Firths. He did not halt (anywhere) until he came to Thraswick in Caithness, to master Skeggi’s house.  He passed the ship there to Kolbein and David, and Kolbein sailed in the ship to Norway, but David stayed behind in the Fair Isle. Kari was in Caithness that winter. That winter, his housewife died in Iceland.

**Um sumarið eftir bjóst Kári til Íslands. Skeggi fékk honum byrðing. Voru þeir þar á átján. Þeir urðu heldur síðbúnir og sigldu þó í haf og höfðu langa útivist. En um síðir tóku þeir Ingólfshöfða og brutu þar skipið allt í spón en þó varð mannbjörg. Kafahríð var á. Spyrja þeir nú Kára hvað nú skal til ráða taka en hann sagði það ráð að fara til Svínafells og reyna þegnskap Flosa. Gengu þeir þá til Svínafells í hríðinni.**

*The next summer Kari busked him for Iceland. Skeggi gave him a ship of burden, and there were eighteen of them on board her. They were rather late "boun," but still they put to sea, and had a long passage, but at last they made Ingolf's Head. There their shin was dashed all to pieces, but the men's lives were saved. Then, too, a gale of wind came on them.
Now they ask Kari what counsel was to be taken; but he said their best plan was to go to Swinefell and put Flosi's manhood to the proof. So they went right up to Swinefell in the storm.*

The next summer, Kari made prepared himself for Iceland. Skeggi lent him a ship, and eighteen people boarded the ship. They were ready rather late (in the season), but still they put to sea, and they had a long journey. At last they made it to Ingolf’s Head (where is this?). Their ship broke to peaces, but the men’s lives were saved. Then a storm dived onto them??? 
They asked Kari for advice, but he said the best plan would be to go to Swinefell and put Flosi’s generosity to the test. So they went up to Swinefell in the storm.

**Flosi var í stofu. Hann kenndi Kára er hann kom í stofuna og spratt upp í móti honum og minntist til hans og setti hann í hásæti hjá sér. Flosi bauð Kára að vera þar um veturinn. Kári þá það. Sættust þeir þá heilum sáttum. Flosi gifti þá Kára Hildigunni bróðurdóttur sína er Höskuldur Hvítanesgoði hafði átta. Bjuggu þau þá fyrst að Breiðá.**

*Flosi was in the hall. He knew Kari as soon as ever he came into the hall, and sprang up to meet him, and kissed him, and sate him down in the high-seat by his side. Flosi asked Kari to be there that winter, and Kari took his offer. Then they were atoned with a full atonement. Then Flosi gave away his brother's daughter Hildigunna, whom Hauskuld the priest of Whiteness had had to wife, to Kari, and they dwelt first of all at Broadwater.*

Flosi was in the hall. He recognised Kari as soon as he came into the hall, and sprang up to meet him, and kissed him, and sat him down by his side on the high-seat. Flosi asked Kari if he could remain there that winter. Kari accepted. Then they settled to an agreement. 
Then Flosi married Kari to the daughter of his brother, Hildigunna, who was family of Hauskuld, the goði of Hvítanes. They lived at first at Breiðá. 

**Það segja menn að þau yrðu ævilok Flosa að hann færi utan þá er hann var orðinn gamall að sækja sér skálavið og var hann í Noregi þann vetur. En um sumarið varð hann síðbúinn. Menn ræddu um að vant væri skip hans. Flosi sagði vera ærið gott gömlum og feigum og sté á skip og lét í haf og hefir til þess skips aldrei spurst síðan.
Þessi voru börn þeirra Kára Sölmundarsonar og Helgu Njálsdóttur: Þorgerður og Ragneiður og Valgerður og Þórður er inni brann. En börn þeirra Hildigunnar og Kára voru þeir Starkaður og Þórður og Flosi. Son Flosa var Kolbeinn er ágætastur maður hefir verið einnhver í þeirri ætt.
Og lúkum vér þar Brennu-Njáls sögu.**

*Men say that the end of Flosi's life was, that he fared abroad, when he had grown old, to seek for timber to build him a hall; and he was in Norway that winter, but the next summer he was late "boun"; and men told him that his ship was not seaworthy. These were the children of Kari Solmund's son and Helga Njal's daughter - Thorgerda and Ragneida, Valgerda, and Thord who was burnt in Njal's house. But the children of Hildigunna and Kari were these, Starkad, and Thord, and Flosi. The son of Burning-Flosi was Kolbein, who has been the most famous man of any of that stock. 
And here we end the saga of Burnt Njal.*

Flosi said she was quite good enough for an old and death-doomed man, and bore his goods on shipboard and put out to sea. But of that ship no tidings were ever heard.

Men say that the end of Flosi’s life had come and he put out to sea when he had become old, to seek timber for his boat, and he was in Norway that winter. In the summer he was late for sailing. Men said his ship had disappeared. Flosi said that he had become old and tired of life. He boarded the ship and put to sea, but no one has ever heard from (of?) this ship again. 

These were the children of Kári Solmundsson and Helga Njálsdóttir: Þorgerður and Ragneiður and Valgerður and Þórður, who was burnt. And the children of Hildigunna and Kári were: Starkaður and Þórður and Flosi. Kolbeinn was the son of Flosi, who was the most famous men of that family.

And here we end the saga of Burnt Njál.
