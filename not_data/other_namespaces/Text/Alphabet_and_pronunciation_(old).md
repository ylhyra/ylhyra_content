==Pronouncing the letters==
First we have the simple vowel sounds:

*'''{{listen|a|audio=GNxf.mp3}}''' – like the English ''f'''a'''ther''.
**m'''a'''ður, t'''a'''kk, m'''a'''mm'''a''', sof'''a''', h'''a'''mborg'''a'''ri
*'''{{listen|e|audio=j_6G.mp3}}''' – like the English ''b'''e'''t''.
**{{listen|endi|audio=iH5c.mp3}}, hótel, penni, þetta, fallegt,
*'''i''' / '''y''' – like the English ''k'''i'''d''. I and Y are pronounced exactly the same.
**mikið, systir, fyrir, sykur, inni
*{{listen|audio=6jJT.mp3}}'''í''' / '''ý''' – like the English ''s'''ee'''''. Í and Ý are pronounced exactly the same.
**íslenska, tími, pítsa, dýrt, ský
*{{listen|audio=969t.mp3}}'''o''' – like how British people say ''h'''o'''t'' or ''w'''a'''ter''.
**gott, opinn, hamborgari, kreditkort, velkominn
*{{listen|audio=-H8G.mp3}}'''u''' – No English equivalent.<ref group="note">If you start with the '''''i''''' sound in ''k'''i'''d'' and then make your lips round, you will get the Icelandic '''''u'''''.</ref>
**sumar, köttur, mánuður, kunna,
*{{listen|audio=2_et.mp3}}'''ú''' – Like the English ''f'''oo'''d.''
**kaffihús, túristi, númer
*{{listen|audio=3AF6.mp3}}'''ö''' – Like the New Zealand or Cockney pronunciation of ''n'''u'''rse'' or ''b'''i'''rd''.
**jörð, pönnukökur, mistök

Then we have the sounds that are pronounced like a mixture of two other sounds:

*{{listen|audio=Ssb_.mp3}}'''á''' – pronounced like "aú"
**já, strákur, hálftími, hjálp
*{{listen|audio=8aNv.mp3}}'''au''' – pronounced like "öí"
**kaupa, gleraugu, rauðvín, draumur
*{{listen|audio=7tsF.mp3}}'''ei''' / '''ey''' – pronounced like "eí"
**eyra, veisla, heima, dreyma
*{{listen|audio=iD48.mp3}}'''é''' – pronounced like "je"
**tré, rétt, flugvél,
*{{listen|audio=UKe9.mp3}}'''ó''' – pronounced like "oú"
**halló, bók, bróðir
*{{listen|audio=pGvG.mp3}}'''æ''' – pronounced like "aí"
**sæl, næstur, kærasti

More letters:

*{{listen|audio=MoMZ.mp3}}'''b''' – like the English ''s'''p'''am''.
**bjór, banna, lamb
*{{listen|audio=DneW.mp3}}'''p'''
**At the beginning of words, '''''p''''' sounds like the English '''''p'''aper''. Note that it is necessary to blow out a little bit of air after the letter.
***'''p'''appír, '''p'''eningar, '''p'''ítsa, '''p'''abbi
**In the middle of words or at the ends of sentences, '''''p''''' sounds like the Icelandic '''''b''''' or like the English ''s'''p'''am''.
***o'''p'''ið, sá'''p'''a, pi'''p'''ar, pa'''p'''rika, hjál'''p'''
*{{listen|audio=Jap5.mp3}}'''d''' – like the English ''s'''t'''and''.
**dagur, deyja, dansa, eldur, önd
*{{listen|audio=1In-.mp3}}'''t'''
**At the beginning of words, '''''t''''' sounds like the English '''''t'''ie''. Note that it is necessary to blow out a little bit of air after the letter.
***'''t'''ími, '''t'''akk, '''t'''e, '''t'''ónlist
**In the middle of words or at the ends of sentences, '''''t''''' sounds like the Icelandic '''''d''''' or like the English ''s'''t'''and''.
***fó'''t'''ur, ma'''t'''ur, sæ'''t'''ur, ú'''t'''i, tóma'''t'''ur

The following two letters are especially tricky to remember. Listen to the audio recordings closely, you should not memorize the rules behind them but it can be helpful to be aware of them:

*{{anchor|G}}'''g'''
**{{listen|audio=YJEW.mp3}}At the beginning of words or before '''''l''''' or '''''n''''', it sounds like the English ''s'''k'''y''.
***gaman, glaður, glas, gott, magnað, rafmagn, regla, fugl
**{{listen|audio=7M7w.mp3}}Usually if the next letter is '''''e''''', '''''i''''', '''''í''''', '''''j''''', '''''y''''', '''''ý''''', '''''æ''''', '''''ei''''' or '''''ey''''', then '''''g''''' sounds similar to the English ''s'''k'''ew''. Many learners have difficulties with this sound, so it can be helpful to imagine ''gær'' being written as "''gyær''", and ''gefa'' written as "''gyefa''". Instead of being pronounced by closing the throat like a normal ''g'', this sound is pronounced by having the most backwards part of your tongue touch the roof of your mouth.
***gítar, gefa, giska, gær, geyma, leggjast, herbergi, ógeðslega, ágæt, Belgía,
**{{listen|audio=0lfb.mp3}}In the middle of words, '''''g''''' is a very soft sound. If you are an English speaker, start with the '''''k''''' sound in ''s'''k'''y'', but don't stop the air completely, let some air through while <u>using</u> your voice.
***laga, aðallega, saga
**{{listen|audio=cZmR.mp3}}At the ends of sentences and also before a '''t''' or '''s''', it is a soft throaty breath. If you are an English speaker, start with the '''''k''''' sound in ''s'''k'''y'', but don't stop the air completely, let some air through <u>without</u> using your voice.
***la'''g''', ég hef sa'''g'''t, róle'''g'''t, til samféla'''g'''sins
**{{listen|audio=tDNq.mp3}}If the letter is between a vowel and '''''j''''' or '''''i''''', it sounds like the Icelandic '''''j''''' or the English '''''y'''es'':
***magi, allt í lagi, félagið, boginn, föstudaginn, sundlaugin,
**If the letter is between '''''á''''', '''''ó''''', '''''ú''''', and '''''a''','' '''''u''''', then there is no sound:
***fljúga, skógur, ljúga, plága
*'''k'''
**{{listen|audio=8dpU.mp3}}At the beginning of words, '''''k''''' sounds like the English '''''k'''ite''. Note that it is necessary to blow out a little bit of air after the letter.
***'''k'''aka, '''k'''ók, kaffi, kalt, kaupa
**{{listen|audio=c__j.mp3}}At the beginning of word, before '''e''', '''i''', '''í''', '''y''', '''ý''', '''æ''', '''ei''' or '''ey''', the letter sounds like the English '''''c'''ute''. Many learners have difficulties with this sound, so it can be helpful to imagine ''kennari'' being written as "''kyennari''", and ''kærasti'' written as "''kyærasti''". Instead of being pronounced by closing the throat like a normal ''k'', this sound is pronounced by having the most backwards part of your tongue touch the roof of your mouth.
***'''k'''ennari, '''k'''ind, '''k'''íló, '''k'''ynnast, '''k'''ærasti, '''k'''irkja, '''K'''eflavík,
**{{listen|audio=7M7w.mp3}}In the middle of a word, before '''e''', '''i''', '''í''', '''y''', '''ý''', '''æ''', '''ei''' or '''ey''', the letter sounds like the English ''s'''k'''ew''. This is the same sound as the ''g'' in ''gítar''. This is almost the same sound as with ''kennari'' above, just without the small breath of air after the sound. 
***tæ'''k'''i, ólí'''k'''ir, po'''k'''i, ban'''k'''i
**{{listen|audio=YJEW.mp3}}At the end of words, or in the middle of words where the next letter is '''a''', '''á''', '''é''', '''o''', '''ó''', '''u''', '''ú''' or '''ö''', the letter sounds like the Icelandic '''''g''''' or like the English ''s'''k'''y''.
***ka'''k'''a, kó'''k''', rí'''k'''ur, bæ'''k'''ur
**{{listen|audio=cZmR.mp3}}If the next letter is '''''t''''', the letter sounds like a soft throaty breath (same as the sound '''''g''''' makes in ''róle'''g'''t''). If you are an English speaker, start with the '''''k''''' sound in ''s'''k'''y'', but don't stop the air completely, let some air through <u>without</u> using your voice.
***o'''k'''tóber, Vi'''k'''tor, ka'''k'''tus, ræ'''k'''ta, kí'''k'''tu, do'''k'''tor, ly'''k'''t

More letters:

*'''ð'''
**'''''ð''''' is usually a very soft sound. It is practically the same as the sound in ''bro'''th'''er'', but while in English the tongue can stick out of the mouth, in Icelandic the tongue touches the back of the teeth. This letter never appears at the start of words. Sometimes this letter is so soft that it almost disappears.
***bróðir, ógeðslegt, orðabók, aðallega
***Listen to the following examples where the speaker makes his '''''ð'''''<nowiki/>'s so soft that they actually disappear:
****Hvað er þetta?, mánuður, aðallega
**However, at the end of sentences, it sounds like the Icelandic '''''þ''''' or the English ''ba'''th'''''.
***orð, búð, bað,
*'''þ'''
**'''''þ''''' is practically the same as the sound in ''ba'''th''''' or '''''th'''ick'', but while in English the tongue can stick out of the mouth, in Icelandic the tongue touches the back of the teeth.
***'''þ'''ykkur, '''þ'''ú, '''þ'''ýða
**Occasionally in sentences when the word in unstressed, '''''þ''''' sounds like the Icelandic '''''ð''''':
***Er það gott?,
**Occasionally when speaking unclearly, '''''þ''''' sounds like '''''h''''':
***Er það þessi?, Þetta er flott.
**Occasionally when speaking quickly, '''''þ''''' completely disappears:
***Hvað er þetta?
*'''v'''
**vinur, vakandi, tveir, alveg
*'''f'''
**At the beginning of words or ends of sentences, it sounds like '''f'''.
***foss, fimm, frí
**In the middle of words, it sounds like '''v'''.
***afi, æfing, úlfur, gefa,
*'''h'''
**hótel, hamar, hús
*'''j'''
**já, bjór, hjá
*'''l'''
**Usually it sounds like a normal '''''l'''''.
***land, heili, gulur, lamb
**But when it's at the end of sentences or next to certain consonants, it sounds like an '''''l''''' while whispering, while blowing extra air in the sides of the cheeks.
***hjálp, hjól, gult, salt
**Double '''''l''''' most often sounds like '''''dl''''' where the first sound is like the Icelandic '''''d''''' or English ''s'''t'''and'', and the second sound is like the  '''''l''''' above (whispering, while blowing extra air in the sides of the cheeks).
***{{listen|full}}, {{listen|lítill}}, {{listen|allir}}, {{listen|jökull}}, {{listen|engill}}, {{listen|krókódíll}}
**However, in some words '''''ll''''' just sounds like a normal '''''l'''''. Those words are either foreign or cute:
***{{listen|halló}}, {{listen|milljón}}, {{listen|brilljant}}, {{listen|bolla}}, {{listen|Solla}}, {{listen|Halli}}, núll
*'''n'''
**Usually it sounds like a normal '''''n'''''.
***nei, nýr, núll
**But when it's next to certain consonants, it sounds like an '''''n''''' without using the voice, only blowing air out of the nose with the mouth closed:
***planta, prenta, kynntist, beint
*'''m'''
**Usually it sounds like a normal '''''m'''''.
***mamma, um, magi
**But when it's next to certain consonants, it sounds like an '''''m''''' without using the voice, only blowing air out of the nose with the mouth closed. This is the same sound you make when you say "hmm".
***lampi, svampur, fimmti, sjampó, skemmtilegur
*'''r'''

::''Main article: [[R]]''

*'''s'''
**sandur, bless
*'''x''' is the same as in English.
**texti, buxur, strax, box

==Other pronunciation rules==

===Blowing out air===
Before the double letters kk, tt, and pp, you need to blow out air, like you were adding a little "h" in front of them.
