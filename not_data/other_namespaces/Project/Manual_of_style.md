title: Project:Manual of style
---

These are recommendations for which style to follow when translating material:

*Word translations are lowercase even when translating the first word of the sentence.
*Group words together where it makes sense. Always group the infinitive mark „að“ with verbs („að vera“).
*American English is used.

The following are not currently standardized and will need to be decided on:

*Should pronouns be translated in the context of Icelandic or English? That is, should „hún“ in „Ég drekk mjólk, hún er góð“ be translated as "she" or "it".
*Should Icelandic quotation marks be used around Icelandic examples in English text?
