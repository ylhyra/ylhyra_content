---'''Ylhýra''' is a project analogous to LARA, but which has a stronger focus on manual word-for-word translations. Interlinear gloss, translations on mouse-over, and synchronized audio are used to encourage learners to continue reading challenging texts. 

==Detailed translations over automatic translations==
Automatic translations and dictionary definitions are beneficial, but manual translations can be more helpful, more specific, and more correct. The reader can have trust in the translations offered, as opposed to the automatic ones which may be confusing or incorrect.

===Interlinear gloss===
Interlinear glosses are translations placed between the lines of the text. They allow a reader to skip over the most difficult words while still being introduced to the word. Since the reading is not halted it can make difficult texts more enjoyable. This both encourages people to continue reading and limits frustration.

===Synchronized audio===
With the use of automatic audio synchronization, we highlight the relevant section.

==Speed of creation==
Manual translations are fairly time-consuming to create, but not prohibitively so. To speed up creation the system does two things:

*Requests suggestions from Google Translate. Both sentences and words are translated.
*Shows suggestions from your previous translations, and from a dictionary list.

The steps to create a fully annotated text are:

*Translating sentences
*Translating words
*Marking which words are difficult and those benefitting from interlinear glosses
*Recording the audio for the entire text
*Recording the missing audio for the words

Annotating a 500 word passage can take around 1 hour, or slightly longer than it takes to read a difficult text with a group of students.

==Use of wiki-software for encouraging collaboration==

*MediaWiki
**high degree of freedom for developing courses
**encourages collaborative editing
**ability to allow both students and random outsiders to create their own material
**openness can be controlled:
***only allow trusted individuals to contribute to certain articles,
***allow others to suggest edits which will be approved or rejected
**encourages continuous incremental improvements and forces you to publish immediately
